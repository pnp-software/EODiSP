      This page describes the HLA Federates that are provided with the EarthCARE Simulator. 
      The HLA Federates are accessible through a centralized <a href="overview.html#SimulationRepository">repository</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EarthCARE federates essentially consist of wrappers for the <a href="simulationPackages.html"> 
      simulation packages</a>. Their structure complies with the <a href="http://www.pnp-software.com/eodisp/documentation/developerManuals/supportApplications.html#WrapperStructure" class="external">general 
      structure</a> of EODiSP wrappers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HLA Federates are described in terms of their <i>Simulation Object Model</i> 
      or SOM. The SOM fully describes the type of information that an individual federate 
      can provide to an HLA federation as well as the information that an individual federate 
      can receive from other federates in the HLA federation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the following elements are included in the SOMs of the EarthCARE federates: 
      <ul> <li><code>objectClasses</code> to describe the attributes published by each 
      federates.</li> <li><code>synchronizations</code> to describe the synchronization 
      points used by the federates.</li> <li><code>dataTypes</code> to describe the types 
      of attributes published by the federates.</li> <li><code>interactions</code> to describe 
      the HLA interactions used by the federates.</li> </ul> The sections below describe 
      the usage of the above elements in the EarthCARE federates. The <a href="#FederateCode">last 
      section</a> in the page explains how to access the federate SOMs and the code implementing 
      them.

    <p>
      The HLA standard prescribes that all object classes be derived from the predefined 
      <code>HLAobjectRoot</code> class. This is accordingly the top-level class for the 
      object classes defined in the EarthCARE SOMs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to create a dedicated namespace for the EarthCARE object classes, the <code>EarthCARE</code> 
      object class is defined as a child of the <code>HLAobjectRoot</code> class and as 
      the direct parent of all EarthCARE object classes. This object class is empty and 
      defines no attributes. All the other object classes defined by the EarthCARE SOMs 
      are child classes of <code>EarthCARE</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EarthCARE object classes are defined to be either pure 'publish' or pure 'subscribe' 
      classes. Their attributes are either 'publish' or 'subscribe' attributes ('publishSubscribe' 
      atttributes are not used) and a certain class only contain attributes of the same 
      kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are basically two types of federates in the EarthCARE Simulator. One type is 
      represented by the <code>sim_controller</code> federate. The second type is represented 
      by all the other federates (the federates wrapping the KNMI models and the <code>orbit_propagator</code> 
      federate). The typical structure of the SOM of the latter kind of federate is shown 
      in the figure below.
    </p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="LidFilter.png"><img border="0" src="images/LidFilter.png" alt="SOM of the lid_filter federate"></img></a><p>Figure 1: SOM of the lid_filter federate</p></div>
    <p>
      This SOM has three kinds of object classes. The <code>FederateInfo</code> object 
      class is common to all federates except the <code>sim_controller</code> federate. 
      It defines attributes that are published by all these federates and that relate to 
      their general execution status. The <code>LidFiltePar</code> object class defines 
      the configuration parameters of the federates. All federates (except the <code>sim_controller</code> 
      federate) have such a <code>xxxPar</code> object class (where 'xxx' is the name of 
      the federate) to define their configuration parameters. Finally the <code>xxxStream</code> 
      object classes describe the files that the federate generates as outputs or reads 
      as inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SOM of the <code>sim_controller</code> federate has a structure that is the complement 
      of those of the other federates: it subscribes to the <code>FederateInfo</code> object 
      class which is published by all other federates, and it publishes all the <code>xxxPar</code> 
      object classes. The <code>sim_controller</code> federate does not see the stream 
      object classes because these only mediate exchanges of data between the other federates.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="TheFederateInfoObjectClass"></a><h2>The FederateInfo Object Class</h2>
    <p>
      There are some key data that are published by all federates (except the <code>sim_controller</code> 
      federate) and which are intended to be displayed through an excel interface by the 
      <code>sim_controller</code> federate. In order to facilitate their uniform treatment, 
      these data are gathered together in one single object class called the <code>FederateInfo</code>. 
      Its attributes are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>name</code>: the name of the KNMI program embedded within the federate or 'orbit_propagator' 
        for the <code>orbit_propagator</code> federate.</li>
      <li><code>modelVersion</code>: a string defining the version of the program embedded 
        within the federate.</li>
      <li><code>failureMode</code>: a flag indicating the <a href="overview.html#FailureModes">failure 
        mode</a> of the federate.</li>
      <li><code>execStatus</code>: a flag indicating the execution status of the federate. 
        This flag essentially indicates whether the program embedded within the federate 
        has already run or whether the federate is still waiting for some or all of its input 
        data.</li>
      <li><code>senderId</code>: the federate handle, namely an integer uniquely identifying 
        the federate that is updating the attributes in this object class.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <code>sim_controller</code> federate subscribes to the <code>FederateInfo</code> 
      object class. When it receives a notification that one of its attributes have been 
      updated, it needs to know which federate did the update. For this reason, the EarthCARE 
      federates are designed to always send the value of the <code>senderId</code> attribute 
      together with the value of the updated attribute. The presence of the <code>senderId</code> 
      allows the <code>sim_controller</code> federate to identify the origin of the update 
      and to process it appropriately.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="TheParameterObjectClasses"></a><h2>The Parameter Object Classes</h2>
    <p>
      Most simulation models need to be configured by specifying the values of certain 
      <a href="overview.html#SimulationParameters">simulation parameters</a>. The EarthCARE 
      federates accordingly define object classes to hold the model parameters. For each 
      federate that needs the specification of one or more simulation parameter, an object 
      class with a name like 'xxxPar' is defined where 'xxx' is the name of the federate. 
      This object class defines the attributes associated to the simulation parameters 
      associated to the federate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The federate subscribes to the parameter object class. All the parameter object classes 
      are published by the <code>sim_controller</code> federate.
    </p>
    <p>All parameter attributes are defined to be of primitive type.</p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="TheFileStreamObjectClasses"></a><h2>The File Stream Object Classes</h2>
    <p>
      The KNMI programs exchange information through files that represent their inputs 
      and outputs. These input and output files are mapped to object classes in the federates 
      that wrap the programs. For each input or output file a dedicated object class is 
      defined with a name like 'xxxStream' where 'xxx' is the name of the file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The file stream object classes cover both <a href="overview.html#FileAccessModes">file 
      access modes</a> supported by the EarthCARE Simulation. The files generated by the 
      KNMI programs can be very large (with sizes of hundres of megabytes or even gigabytes). 
      For this reason, their transfer through the HLA infrastructure must be done in chunks 
      of size sufficiently small to fit within the address space of the JVM where the federates 
      are running. The size of each chunk is fixed and is defined as an initialization 
      parameter for the federate itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attributes of the file stream object classes are: <ul> <li><code>chunk</code>: 
      a byte array representing a chunk of the file that is being transferred. </li> <li><code>chunkNr</code>: 
      an integer defining the chunk that is being sent in this transfer. </li> <li><code>nrOfChunks</code>: 
      the total number of chunks in the current transfer.</li> <li><code>url</code>: a 
      string representing the URL of the input or output file.</li> </ul> Obviously, the 
      last attribute is only used when the federate is operating in url transfer mode.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="DataTypes"></a><h2>Data Types</h2>
    <p>
      The EarthCARE federates only use a small set of data types. Three kinds of HLA data 
      types are used: basic data types, enumerated data types, and array data types.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="SynchronizationPoints"></a><h2>Synchronization Points</h2>
    <p>
      The EarthCARE federates use the five <a href="http://www.pnp-software.com/eodisp/overview.html#SimulationLifecycle" class="external">synchronization 
      points</a> predefined by the EODiSP (EODISP_START, EODISP_PAUSE, EODISP_STEP, EODISP_RESUME, 
      and EODISP_STOP). No additional simulator-specific synchronization points are defined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EODiSP synchronization points are registered by the EODiSP control federate. 
      The EarthCARE federates therefore are only responsible for achieving these synchronization 
      points.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EODiSP_START synchronization point is achieved after all attribute subscriptions 
      and publications have been completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the EODiSP_START synchronization point has been achieved, each federate is 
      ready to react to a notification that one of its input attributes (i.e. one of the 
      attributes to which it subscribes) has been updated. At this point there are two 
      flows of attribute updates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>info flow</i> is related to the update of attributes in the <code>FederateInfo</code> 
      object class. Federates that publish this object class are designed to update attributes 
      in this class immediately after the EODiSP_START synchronization point is achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>simulation flow</i> is related to the generation and processing of the KNMI 
      input and output files. This flow starts only after the <code>sim_controller</code> 
      federate updates the <a href="overview.html#SimulationParameters">configuration parameters</a> 
      of all the other federates.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all configuration parameters have been updated by the <code>sim_controller</code> 
      federate, the simulation proper starts. The <code>scene_creator</code> federate, 
      which does not depend on any input file, triggers the execution of the <code>scene_creator</code> 
      program. When this program terminates, it makes its output file available and therefore 
      releases the execution of the forward model federates (the <code>lid_filter</code> 
      federate, the <code>rad_filter</code> federate, the <code>MC_sim_main</code> federate, 
      and the <code>MC_LW_sim_main</code> federate). And so on until all programs embedded 
      within the KNMI federates have been executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The KNMI federates achieve the EODiSP_STOP synchronization point after the program 
      which they embed has completed execution. The other two federates - which are purely 
      passive - achieve it immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pause, step and resume mechanism is implemented at the level of two KNMI federates: the 
      <code>radar</code> and the <code>lidar_ret1</code> federates. 
      For this purpose, these KNMI federates can be placed in an 'inhibited' state. If they 
      are in this state, then they will not execute the program they embed even if all 
      their input data have arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause request is intended to cause the simulation to stop after the currently executing 
      KNMI programs have terminated execution. The EODiSP_PAUSE synchronization point in 
      the <code>radar</code> and the <code>lidar_ret1</code> federates 
      is achieved after the federates have been placed in the 'inhibited' 
      state. In the case of other federates, it is achieved immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      A step request can only have an effect if it is preceeded by a pause request. It 
      causes all and only the programs that have all their inputs available (but are being 
      held because the simulator received a pause request) to be executed. KNMI federates 
      that have all their inputs ready, achieve the EODiSP_STEP synchronization point after 
      the program they embed has been executed. All other federates achieve it immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      A resume request is intended to cause the simulation to resume execution. The EODiSP_RESUME 
      synchronization point in the 
      <code>radar</code> and the <code>lidar_ret1</code> federates is achieved after the federate 
      is taken 
      out of the 'inhibited' state. Federates whose input data are ready, will therefore 
      immediately resume execution.
    </p>
