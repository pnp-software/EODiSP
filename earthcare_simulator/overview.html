      This page introduces the <i>EarthCARE Simulator</i>. The EarthCARE Simulator was created by
      instantiating the <a href="http://www.pnp-software.com/eodisp" class="external">EODiSP platform</a>. 
      The EarthCARE Simulator is end-to-end performance mission
      simulator for the EarthCARE mission. The EarthCARE mission is
	  an earth observation satellite mission under development at <a href="http://www.esa.int" class="external">ESA</a>.
	  Most of the simulation packages integrated in the EarthCARE Simulator were developed by 
	  <a href="http://www.knmi.nl/" class="external">KNMI</a> 
      as part of their contribution to the phase A EarthCARE study.

    <p>
     The instantiation of the EODiSP to build the EarthCARE Simulator has two objectives.
     <ul>
     <li>To create a simulator that can be used to perform the
     <a href="http://www.pnp-software.com/eodisp/documentation/Testing.html" class="external">system-level 
     verification of the EODiSP</a>.</li>
     <li>To provide a blueprint for prospective users of the EODiSP of how they can use 
     the EODiSP to create their own simulators.</li>
     </ul>
     An EODiSP simulation is built by integrating a set of <i>simulation packages</i> 
      with the EODiSP infrastructure. A simulation package is a piece of software that 
      implements part of the functionalities required for an end-to-end simulation and 
      that is delivered as a single unit. A simulation package encapsulates one or more 
      <i>simulation models</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simulation models normally take the forms of algorithms, possibly defined in 
      some modelling environment such as Matlab. The simulation packages implement the simulation 
      model algorithms in software. Simulation packages can take a variety of forms: source 
      code in a high-level language, binary level executable, macros in an excel spreadsheet, 
      etc. In the EarthCARE Simulator, three kinds of simulation packages are used: excel
      spreadsheets, linux executables available in binary form only, and Java source code.
    </p>
    <p>
     With reference to the above objectives, this web site describes:
     <ul>
     <li>The <a href="simulationPackages.html">simulation packages</a> that 
     compose the EarthCARE Simulator;</li>
     <li>The <a href="HLAFederates.html">wrappers</a> that transform the simulation
     packages into HLA Federates ready to be integrated with the EODiSP infrastructure;
     </li>
     <li>The repositories where the HLA Federates are registered.</li>
     </ul>
     Note that this web site is intended to describe a <i>simulator</i>, not a particular
     <i>simulation</i>. The simulator described here can be used to perform several
     simulations. Some of these simulations were used to 
     <a href="http://www.pnp-software.com/eodisp/documentation/Testing.html" class="external">demonstrate</a> the correct implementation
     of the EODiSP and are described in the EODiSP web site.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="SimulatorArchitecture"></a><h2>Simulator Architecture</h2>
    <p>  
     The EarthCARE simulator is based on the end-to-end performance simulator developed at 
      <a href="http://www.knmi.nl/" class="external">KNMI</a> for the 
	  phase A EarthCARE mission. The KNMI simulator
	  consists of a set of stand-alone programs running on a Linux platform. Each program
	  models one element of the end-to-end observation chain. 
	</p>   
    <p>
	  The starting point of the observation chain is a <i>scene creator</i> 
	  program that generates a <i>scene file</i>. The scene file models the physical scene that 
	  is observed
	  by the EarthCARE instruments. The next item in the chain is a set of <i>forward models 
	  programs</i>
	  which simulate the propagation of signals from the scene to the satellite instruments. 
	  The third
	  item in the chain is a set of <i>instrument model programs</i> that simulate the satellite instruments.
	  The last item in the chain is a set of <i>retrieval model programs</i> that simulate the post processing 
	  of the instrument data. A set of utility programs are also available to plot the results of the
	  data retrieval and to extract geophysical data from scene files.
	  The simulator programs
	  exchange information through data files. 
    </p>   
    <p>  	  
	  The KNMI simulator is described in detail in a publicly available 
	  <a href="download/Sim_ug.pdf">user guide</a>. 
	</p>   
    <p>
      The EODiSP EarthCARE simulator is based on a nearly complete subset of the programs 
      in the KNMI EarthCARE simulator.
      Its architecture is shown in the figure below. Blue boxes in the 
      figure represent KNMI simulator programs wrapped as HLA federates. The names in the boxes are 
      the same as the names used in
      the KNMI documentation. 
      Red boxes represent federates that were developed specifically for the
      EODiSP EarthCARE Simulator and do not therefore come from KNMI. 
    </p>   
    <p>  
      The arrows in the figure represent data flows. The structure of the data
      generated and consumed by the KNMI programs is too complex to be represented graphically.
      The arrows therefore only indicate which program is providing data to which other program but they
      do not say anything about the kind of data that is being exchanged. The <code>sim_controller</code>
      federate sends data to and receives data from all the other federates in the simulator.
      For simplicity, its connections are not shown in the figure.
    </p>
     <div class="figure"><a name="simulatorArchitecture_1.png"><img border="0" src="images/simulatorArchitecture_1.png" alt="EarthCARE Simulator Architecture"></img></a><p>Figure 1: EarthCARE Simulator Architecture</p></div>
    <p>  
      The starting point of the processing chain simulated by the demonstrator is 
      the <code>scene_creator</code> utility that is used 
      to generate a scene file. 
      The scene file defines the physical scene to be observed by the EarthCARE instruments.  
      The scene data are processed, in four parallel branches, by the 
      four EarthCARE forward models: <code>lid_filter</code>, <code>rad_filter</code>, 
      <code>MC_sim_main</code>, and <code>MC_LW_sim_main</code>. The phase A EarthCARE 
      mission included four instruments (RADAR, LIDAR, BBR and MSI). Of these, only two - the RADAR
      and the LIDAR - are explicitly modelled in the simulator (federates <code>lidar</code>
      and <code>radar</code>). Finally, the simulator includes three retrieval models:
      <code>lidar_ret1</code>, <code>msi_ret</code>, and <code>lw_msi_lidar_radar</code>.
    </p>   
    <p>
      In addition to the federates built around KNMI models, the EarthCARE Simulator includes 
      two federates that were developed specifically for it:
      <ul>
      <li>The <code>orbit_propagator</code> federate provides the spacecraft orbital 
      position as an input for other models. The present version is a dummy intended for
      demonstration purposes that 
      outputs hard-coded values for the sun aspect angles.</li>
      <li>The <code>sim_controller</code> federate is built around a set of excel spreadsheets
      that allow the user to control and display the simulation parameters through a simple 
      graphical interface. Dynamic update of simulation parameters while a simulation is running is
      also possible.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>   
    <p>  
      Note that the EODiSP EarthCARE simulator - like the KNMI simulator from which it is 
      derived - only simulates the 
      processing of one single
      scene. Hence, the data flows shown in the figure are only executed once in a single 
      simulation run. 
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="FileAccessModes"></a><h2>File Access Modes</h2>
    <p>  
      The EarthCARE Simulation federates are implemented by wrapping the corresponding KNMI programs
      as HLA federates. No changes are made to the original KNMI code. 
     </p>
     <p> 
      The HLA interfaces of the 
      EarthCARE federates are defined by the attributes the federates publish and
      by the attributes they subscribe to.
     </p>
     <p>  
      The attributes that an EarthCARE federate publishes and subscribes to are implicitly defined by the inputs 
      and outputs of the associated KNMI program. These inputs and outputs take the form of files.
	  Conceptually, the HLA wrappers map        
      each file that is produced by one of the KNMI programs to an HLA attribute. 
      At implementation level, two options are possible for managing these input and output files:
      <ul>
      <li>A file remains on the same distribution node as the program that generates it. The
      federates that encapsulate the programs that read the file must then provide mechanisms to
      allow a remote access to the file. In this case, it is only the URL of the file that is
      physically transferred from a federate to another.</li>
      <li>
      A file is represented as a sequence of bytes (an HLA attribute of type 
      <code>HLAopaqueData</code>) that is transferred from one federate to the next. In this case,
      the entire content of the file is transferred from the federate producing the file to the
      federates consuming it. Note that if several federates are using the same file as an
      input, then the file content is transferred several times and multiple copies of the file
      are created (possibly residing on the same computational node).</li>
      </ul>
      The choice between the two approaches depends on the pattern of access to a file on the part
      of the KNMI programs, on the size of the files, and on the distribution architecture of a
      simulation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If a federate needs to access a file several times during its execution and
      if the file is generated at a remote location, 
      then the transfer of the file content to the federate that needs it may be
      the most efficient solution. If, on the other hand, the files are very large and used by
      several federates, then it may be more advantageous to keep them where they are 
      created and to simply transfer their URL to the federates that need to access them.
      The latter solution, quite obviously, is also the optimal solution in case 
      all federates reside on the same computational node.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EarthCARE Simulator currently supports only the latter mode, the <i>file transfer mode</i>.
      Thus, the data is always transfered
      between federates, even if they reside on the same node. 
      </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="ExecutionMode"></a><h2>Execution Mode</h2>
    <p>  
      The original KNMI simulator was intended to run sequentially on a single processing
      nodes. The KNMI simulation models are encapsulated in executable programs that run
      one after the other. Each executable runs to completion before handing over to the
      next executable in the processing chain.
    </p>   
    <p>
      The EODiSP supports distributed simulations where various elements of a simulation
      may run in parallel. Such a distributed approach makes eminent sense in the case
      of the EarthCARE simulation for at least two reasons.  Firstly, the forwad
      models are typically very computationally intensive. It is therefore advantageous to 
      locate them on different nodes because this allows them to execute in parallel thus 
      reducing the overall duration of a complete simulation. Secondly, it is often the
      case that some of the models that participate in a simulation are proprietary. 
      The EODiSP approach allows their owners to keep control over them while still allowing 
      them to be included in a simulation.
    </p>   
    <p> 
      The EarthCARE Simulator is designed in the EODiSP spirit to support 
      <a href="http://www.pnp-software.com/eodisp/overview.html#DistributedSimulationPackages" class="external">distributed 
      simulation</a> if the simulation packages are located on distributed nodes. 
    </p>  
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="FailureModes"></a><h2>Failure Modes</h2>
    <p>  
      It is common for simulation models to support the concept of <i>failure modes</i>.
      The failure mode is a flag that the user of the model can set to ask the model
      to emulate a failure condition. The KNMI models do not support failure modes.
      However, for purposes of demonstration, the EarthCARE Simulator includes a facility
      to handle failure modes. 
    </p>   
    <p>
      To each federate (with the exception of the 
      <code>sim_controller</code>), a <code>failureMode</code> flag is associated. The
      value of this flag is visualized by the <code>sim_controller</code> federate and,
      through this same federate, the simulation manager can also ask for the value of
      the flag to be changed. 
    </p>   
    <p>
      Since the KNMI models do not support failure modes, changes
      to the value of the <code>failureMode</code> flag have no effect. However, this
      facility simulates a situation where the simulation manager
      can control, in real-time and while a simulation is running, the failure mode
      of the models that participate in a simulation.
    </p>   
    <p>
      The visualization and change in the value of the failure
      flag is done through the excel interface of the <code>sim_controller</code> federate.
      This demonstrates how excel can be used to build a simple GUI-based control
      interface for an EODiSP federation.
    </p>  
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="DummyFederates"></a><h2>Dummy Federates</h2>
      Some of the KNMI programs that form the heart of the EarthCARE Simulator have very long
      execution times (tens of minutes or more). This is inconvenient for debugging or
      demonstration purposes. For this reason, the EarthCARE Simulator include <i>
      dummy versions</i> of some of the federates that wrap the KNMI programs. 
    <p>
      The KNMI federates wrap an executable that reads one or more input files and generates
      one or more output files. The dummy versions of the KNMI federates do not include any
      executable but they can output an out put file with the same format as the output
      file generated by the KNMI executable.
    </p>
    <p>  
      The dummy federates implement the same HLA interface as the KNMI federate they replace
      (i.e. they comply with the same SOM). The dummy federates are therefore interchangeable
      with the KNMI federates. 
    </p>
    <p>  
      The EarthCARE Demonstrator delivery includes dummy federates for several KNMI
      programs. 
      The dummy federates are characterized by names like <code>xxx_dummy</code> where 
      'xxx' is the name of a KNMI program.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="SimulationParameters"></a><h2>Simulation Parameters</h2>
    <p>  
      The behaviour of simulation models is normally controlled by specifying the values of certain
      parameters. The EarthCARE Simulator supports this type of configuration of its
      models. 
    </p>   
    <p>
      The model parameter values are displayed through the excel interface of the 
      <code>sim_controller</code> federate and, through this same interface, the simulation
      controller can also update their values or load an entire new set of default values for the
      simulation parameters. 
    </p>   
    <p>
      In view of the demonstrator status of the EarthCARE Simulator, the set of simulation 
      parameters that are displayed through the <code>sim_controller</code> 
      federate is only a subset of all the parameters that are defined for the 
      KNMI models. The intention is to demonstrate how simulation parameters can be
      displayed and updated in an EODiSP simulation, rather than to provide access to 
      the full set of KNMI parameters.
    </p>  
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="SimulationExperiments"></a><h2>Simulation Experiments</h2>
    <p>  
      The EODiSP is designed to support the execution of <i>simulation experiments</i>. 
      A simulation experiment is a set of simulation 
      runs executed in sequence with different configurations. A configuration is defined
      by a set of initialization files. An initialization file is a file that is read 
      by the federate during
      the federate initialization phase (i.e. prior to the federate achieving its
      EODISP_START synchronization point). In the EODiSP,
      a federate can have multiple initialization files. These files can be added to a federate
      in the simulation manager application, retaining the order of the files.
    </p>  
    <p>  
      In the case of the 
      EarthCARE Simulator, a simulation configuration is defined by a set of values for the
      <a href="#SimulationParameters">simulation parameters</a>. This set of values is stored
      in the excel file that is embedded within the <code>sim_controller</code> federate.
      This federate is designed to take the excel file as its initialization file. No other
      federate in the EarthCARE Simulator has an initialization file. Hence the 
      <code>sim_controller</code> initialization file defines a configuration in a
      simulation run.
    </p>  
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="SimulationRepository"></a><h2>Simulation Repository</h2>
    <p>  
      In the EODiSP concept, at least one centralized repository must exist where all federates 
      that may take part 
      in a simulation are registered. The <i>EarthCARE Simulation Repository</i> is the 
      centralized repository where the EarthCARE Simulator federates are registered. 
     </p>
     <p> 
	  The EODiSP can operate in two basic modes. In <i>remote mode</i>, one or more of the 
	  federates
	  are located on a remote node (with respect to the simulation manager application). In <i>local mode</i>,
	  all the federates are located on the same platform as the simulation manager application.
	  Operation in remote mode requires the repository to be installed on a publicly accessible server.
	  Operation in local mode requires the repository to be installed locally on the same machine on
	  which the simulation models and the simulation manager application are located. 
	 </p>
     <p> 
      The EarthCARE Simulator is designed for remote mode operation. Its repository is 
	  installed on the P&amp;P Software server located in Germany. Obviously, users who wish to 
	  run an EarthCARE simulation in local mode can do so by setting up a local repository on
	  their own machine. 
     </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="SimulationFederateOwners"></a><h2>Simulation Federate Owners</h2>
   <p>
      In the EODiSP concept, all federates that may take part in a simulation are owned by a
      person or entity. The <i>EarthCARE simulation federate owners</i> are the owners of the 
      federates of the EarthCARE Simulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the EODiSP concept, federates are located on some platform and a simulation can be built by
      integrating federates that reside on different - distributed - platforms. Federate owners must 
      therefore
      be associated to a particular platform where their federates they own are located. 
      The federate owners and their associated platforms for the EarthCARE Simulator are 
      as follows:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>PnP_1: federate owner residing at P&amp;P Software associated to a Linux laptop. </li>
      <li>ETH_2: federate owner residing at ETH-Zurich associated to a Windows laptop.</li>
      <li>Estec_4: federate owner residing at ESA-Estec associated to a Linux desktop.</li>
      <li>Estec_5: federate owner residing at ESA-Estec associated to a Windows desktop.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Federate owners manage their models through the <a href="overview.html#EODiSPUserInterface">EODiSP 
      model manager application</a>. This application is therefore installed on 
      each of the demonstrator owner platforms. Note that the laptop-based federate owners can be physically
      anywhere as long as they have access to the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        The figure below illustrates on which node a federate is running for the EarthCARE Simulator.
        It is the same figure as above, extended with a box for each federate. This box shows the
        federate owner, according to the list given above.
    </p>
     <div class="figure"><a name="federateOwners.png"><img border="0" src="images/federateOwners.png" alt="EarthCARE Simulator Architecture with Federate Owners"></img></a><p>Figure 2: EarthCARE Simulator Architecture with Federate Owners</p></div>
    
    <p>  
      Normally, the various owners contributing federates to a simulator own disjoint subsets of
      federates. In the case of the EarthCARE Simulation, and in view of its demonstrative 
      character, federates are duplicated. This is not shown in the figure above. The figure only
      shows the federates that will be used nominally.
    </p>
    <p> 
      The KNMI programs are designed to run under Linux. Their associated federates can therefore
      only be allocated to Linux-based federate owners. The <code>sim_controller</code> federate
      is built around an excel spreadsheet and must therefore be allocated to a Windows-based
      federate owner. The <code>orbit_propagator</code> federate is implemented as a Java class
      and is therefore platform-independent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EarthCARE Simulator provides two copies of each KNMI federate, with
      each copy allocated to the PnP_1 and Estec_4 federate owners. Similarly, the <code>orbit_propagator</code> federate is provided in four copies
      allocated to each of the four federate owners.
    </p>
    <p>     
      This duplication of federates gives great flexibility in building simulations as it allows
      the simulation manager to select different mixes of federates representing different 
      distribution architecture. Mixing of federates from different platforms is possible and easy
      because federates that implement the same HLA interface are interchangeable and because
      the EODiSP allows seamless integration of distributed simulation packages.      
    </p> 
    <p>
    There is another node that participates in the EarthCARE simulation:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>ETH_3: Running the JXTA rendezvous and relay server, the repository application, and the CRC on a Linux server.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    This node does not run any model manager application but is also important for a functional EarthCARE simulation since it provides
    services needed by all EODiSP simulations. It has been chosen to run this services on a publicly accessible server. However, these
    services could also be run on a local node if the simulation is to be executed locally.
