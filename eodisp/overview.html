    <p>
      The EODiSP is a generic platform to support the development and operation of distributed 
      simulations. An EODiSP simulation is built by integrating a set of <i>simulation packages</i> 
      with the EODiSP infrastructure. A simulation package is a piece of software that 
      implements part of the functionalities required for an end-to-end simulation and 
      that is delivered as a single unit. A simulation package encapsulates one or more 
      <i>simulation models</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simulation models normally take the forms of algorithms, possibly defined in 
      some modelling environment such as Matlab. The simulation packages implement the 
      simulation model algorithms in software. Simulation packages can take a variety of 
      forms: source code in a high-level language, binary level executable, macros in an 
      excel spreadsheet, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the EODiSP approach, users are expected to define the simulation models required 
      for a simulation and to encapsulate them in simulation packages. The EODiSP provides 
      the infrastructure to allow the simulation packages to interact together over a possibly 
      distributed network. The EODiSP is specifically intended to allow the integration 
      of heterogeneous and distributed simulation packages.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="AnHLA-BasedPlatform"></a><h2>An HLA-Based Platform</h2>
    <p>
      The EODiSP is built as a partial implementation of the High-Level Architecture or HLA. The 
      <a HREF="https://www.dmso.mil/public/transition/hla/">HLA</a> is the most widely 
      used simulation architecture. The HLA is defined as an IEEE standard. Adherence to 
      the standard allows interoperability and reusability of simulation packages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HLA is defined as a bundle of services that support various aspects of a simulation. 
      In general, a particular simulator will only need a subset of all the services defined 
      by the HLA. At present, the EODiSP only supports a <a href="./documentation/developerManuals/implementedHLAServices.html">subset 
      of the HLA services</a>. These services are aimed at supporting data-driven simulations. 
      It is expected that more HLA services will be supported in the future.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="HLATerminology"></a><h2>HLA Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      The HLA standard defines a special terminology for describing HLA-based simulations. This 
      terminology is important for understanding the material presented in this web site.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <i>HLA Federate</i> is the basic unit of composition of an HLA-based simulation. 
      A federate encapsulate an application that participates in an HLA-based simulation. 
      In terms of the EODiSP terminology, an HLA federate encapsulates a <i>simulation 
      package</i>. Note that a simulation package is a pre-defined piece of software that 
      has been created prior to the definition of the simulation. It normally cannot be 
      directly integrated in the EODiSP because its external interfaces do not comply 
      with the HLA standard. Such a simulation package must normally be <i>wrapped</i> 
      to be made HLA-compliant. Wrapping transforms the simulation package into an HLA 
      federate ready for integration with the EODiSP platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      An HLA federate is formally described by a <i>Simulation Object Model</i> or SOM. 
      The SOM is an XML-based file that describes the interface of a federate in terms 
      the data it generates as outputs and of the data it requires as inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <i>HLA Federation</i> is a set of federates that are used to build a simulation. 
      An HLA federation is formally described by a <i>Federation Object Model</i> or FOM. 
      The FOM describes how the federates in a federation are connected to each other. 
      The actual operation of an HLA federation is called the <i>HLA Federation Execution</i>.
    </p>
    <p> 
      The HLA defines two mechanisms to allow federates to coordinate their activities.
      <i>Synchronization points</i> allow sets of federates in the same
      federation to synchronize their activities. <i>Interactions</i> allow federates to
      perform actions that have an effect on other federates in the same federation.
      The EODiSP predefined five synchronization points and one interaction. Developers
      may defined additional synchronization points and interactions that are specific
      to their simulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HLA defines the <i>Runtime Infrastructure</i> or RTI. The RTI is a component 
      that provides the generic infrastructure through which federates in a federation 
      execution can exchange data.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="SimulationInterfaces"></a><h2>Simulation Interfaces</h2>
    <p>
      The federates that take part in an EODiSP simulation are characterized by their interfaces. 
      The structure of these interfaces is in turn defined by the HLA standard. At their 
      most basic, the interface defines: <ul> <li>The data the federate needs as input 
      and</li> <li>The data the federate generates as its output</li> </ul> The HLA standard 
      implies a publish-subscribe architecture where federates <i>publish</i> the data 
      they generate as outputs and <i>subscribe</i> to the data they need as input. A federate 
      can only subscribe to data that are published by other federates in the same federation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HLA standard supports both simple primitive types (floats, integers, booleans, 
      etc) and more complex structure-like types. Some basic data types are defined by the
      standard but users can define new user-specific data types.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main advantage of an interface-based environment is that it is easy to replace 
      a simulation package with another simulation package. If the new simulation package 
      has the same interface as the old one, then the change of simulation package has 
      no impact on the rest of the simulation.
    </p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="publishSubscribeArchitecture_1.png"><img border="0" src="images/publishSubscribeArchitecture_1.png" alt="Publish-Subscribe Architecture"></img></a><p>Figure 1: Publish-Subscribe Architecture</p></div>
    <p>
      The figure illustrates the publish-subscribe architecture mandated by the HLA and 
      adopted by the EODiSP. The figure shows a simulation where three simulation packages 
      exchange data. Each simulation package publishes its outputs and links its inputs 
      to the outputs published by other packages. The data that are published and subscribed 
      to by a certain simulation package define that package's interface. The term 'data' 
      here can designate either a single value of primitive type or an instance of a complex 
      data structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure shows the simulation package inputs and outputs being directly connected 
      to each other. This is a logical architecture. The physical architecture may be very 
      different because the transfer of data from a package output to a package input may 
      not be direct (it may, for instance, be routed over a distribution network). This 
      data shuffling however is performed by the EODiSP infrastructure invisibly to the 
      simulation packages.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="Wrappers"></a><h2>Wrappers</h2>
    <p>
      The EODiSP is intended to allow the integration of heterogeneous simulation packages. 
      The EODiSP provides an infrastructure to connect them together and to let them interact 
      with each other to implement a complete simulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EODiSP is built as an implementation of the HLA standard. The HLA defines the 
      interface between the entities participating in a simulation (the <i>HLA federates</i>) 
      and the simulation infrastructure. Hence, in order to be integrated with the EODiSP 
      infrastructure, simulation packages must comply with this HLA-defined interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unrealistic to expect all developers of simulation packages to provide HLA-compliant 
      packages. For this reason, the EODiSP supports the concept of <i>wrapper</i>. A wrapper 
      is a piece of code the transforms a given simulation package into an HLA-compliant 
      federate. The wrapper typically adapts the external interface of a simulation package 
      to make it comply with the HLA requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrappers obviously depend on the structure of the model they wrap. For this reason, 
      it is not possible to provide a 'universal wrapper'. The skeleton of the wrapper -
      the part of the wrapper that interfaces to the EODiSP infrastructure - does however
      have a fixed structure. The EODiSP accordingly provides an application that can
      automatically generate this skeleton. This application is called the
      <i>HLA Wrapper Generator</i>. The generator takes as an
      input an XML-based description of the HLA interface of the target package and automatically
      generates the Java source code that implements the wrapper's skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>  
      Although it is not possible to define a fixed structure for a generic HLA wrapper, 
      it will often happen
      that wrappers that are targeted at similar models to be used in a certain simulator (or,
      perhaps, in a family of related simulators) do have a fixed structure. In such cases,
      it may be advantageous to develop a domain-specific wrapper generator.
    </p>
    <p> 
      The wrapper generators are an example of an EODiSP 
      <a href="./documentation/developerManuals/supportApplications.html">support 
      application</a>. Prior to running an EODiSP simulation, a number of off-line 
      tasks need to be performed. Some of these tasks can be partially or fully automated. 
      An EODiSP support application is an application that helps users in performing these 
      off-line tasks. At present the 
      <a href="./documentation/developerManuals/supportApplications.html#HLAWrapperGenerator">HLA 
      Wrapper Generator</a> is the only support application provided by
      the EODiSP. Other support applications may be provided in the future.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="SimulationParadigm"></a><h2>Simulation Paradigm</h2>
    <p>
      The HLA supports a wide range of simulation paradigms (data driven, time triggered, 
      event driven, etc). The current implementation of the EODiSP privileges the data-driven 
      paradigm. In a data-driven simulation each simulation package is characterised by 
      the data it produces and by the data it generates. Control flow is determined by 
      the arrival of data: a simulation package is triggered as soon as all its input data 
      have become available. The architecture of a simulation is defined by linking data 
      sources (the producers of the data) to data sinks (the consumers of the data).
    </p>
    <p>
      In accordance with the HLA approach, the EODiSP requires that each simulation package 
      participating in a simulation declare which data it publishes (i.e. which data it 
      generates and makes available to other simulation packages) and which data it subscribe 
      to (i.e. which data it requires from other simulation packages). The simulation can 
      only be executed when all simulation packages know where to find the data they consume.
    </p>
    <p>
      The type of simulation packages and the type of data they exchange is of course specific 
      to each simulation. The EODiSP provides a reusable framework that implements the 
      mechanisms for shuffling the data between simulation packages and for triggering 
      the simulation packages. Data shuffling can be done over a distribution network (in case 
      of a distributed simulation) and across language and operating system barriers (in 
      case of simulation packages that are implemented in different languages and run on 
      different platforms).
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="SimulationRunsandSimulationExperiments"></a><h2>Simulation Runs and Simulation Experiments</h2>
    <p>
      In simulation systems, a distinction is often made between a <i>simulation run</i> 
      and a <i>simulation experiment</i>. A simulation experiment is a set of simulation 
      runs executed in sequence with different configurations. A configuration is defined
      by a set of initialization files. An initialization file is a file that is read 
      by a federate during
      the federate initialization phase. In the EODiSP,
      a federate can have at most one initialization file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EODiSP allows users to perform simulation experiments. Note that if a user wishes
      to execute 
      a single simulation run, he can configure a simulation experiment with just one simulation 
      run included.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="DistributedSimulationPackages"></a><h2>Distributed Simulation Packages</h2>
    <p>
      The EODiSP supports the integration of physically distributed simulation packages. 
      The EODiSP allows simulation packages residing on a network of distributed computers 
      to be linked together to participate in a simulation. This allows developers of simulation 
      packages to implement their models on their platform of choice (Unix, Linux, Windows, 
      etc) while preserving the interoperability with other models. <p> </p> The EODiSP distribution 
      infrastructure is built on the Internet. Hence, no special communication hardware 
      or software is required on the nodes that participate in a distributed EODiSP simulation. 
      <p> </p> The EODiSP distribution infrastructure is designed to by-pass firewall protections. 
      This allows simulation packages that reside behind company firewalls to participate 
      in an EODiSP simulation. The overhead that is added by the EODiSP distribution infrastructure 
      is minimal in most cases. <p> </p> The EODiSP can also be used to instantiate non-distributed 
      simulations. Obviously, in this case, there is no overhead connected to the potentially 
      distributed nature of the EODiSP.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="ConceptualStructureofanEODiSPSimulator"></a><h2>Conceptual Structure of an EODiSP Simulator</h2>
    <p>
      The EODiSP is a generic platform that users must customize to build a specific simulator. 
      The figure below shows the conceptual structure of a simulator built using the EODiSP. 
      The dark component at the centre of the figure represent the EODiSP framework. This 
      is the generic simulation infrastructure that provides the mechanisms through which 
      the simulation packages exchange data and control information. This infrastructure 
      is entirely generic. In order to construct a simulation application, it has to be 
      customized with the simulation packages that encapsulate the models that are required 
      to run the simulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simulation packages are represented in the figure by the light boxes. The process 
      of customization of the EODiSP framework is schematically shown in the figure as 
      the plugging of the simulation packages into the EODiSP infrastructure.
    </p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="simulator_structure.png"><img border="0" src="images/simulator_structure.png" alt="Simulator Structure"></img></a><p>Figure 2: Simulator Structure</p></div>
    <p>
      In some cases, the simulation packages are local in the sense that they reside on 
      the same physical platform as the EODiSP framework. In the figure, this is the case 
      of the simulation packages marked <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> . In other cases, the simulation 
      packages are remote in the sense that they are designed to run on a platform different 
      from the platform on which the EODiSP framework is located. In the figure, this is the case 
      of the simulation packages marked <b>C</b> and <b>D</b>. Remote packages are connected 
      to the EODiSP core through a distribution infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process of customisation of the EODiSP framework takes the form of a plugging 
      of the simulation packages into the EODiSP core. The plugging is only possible if 
      the simulation package has an external interface that is compatible with the EODiSP 
      interface. When this is not the case, then the simulation package must be embedded 
      within a wrapper component that performs a translation from the package interface 
      to the interface required by the EODiSP framework. In the figure, this is the case 
      of the simulation package marked as <b>D</b> . Note that wrapping can also be used 
      to resolve other types of incompatibilities such as the case of the EODiSP framework 
      and the simulation packages being implemented in different languages or compiled 
      with different compilers.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="HLAStructureofanEODiSPSimulator"></a><h2>HLA Structure of an EODiSP Simulator</h2>
    <p>
      The previous section described the conceptual structure of a simulator built by instantiating 
      the EODiSP. This section describes how this conceptual structure is implemented on 
      top of the HLA.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure discussed in the previous section can be re-cast as shown below. The simulation 
      packages taking part in a simulation are now shown as HLA federates. The HLA defines 
      the interfaces to which the simulation packages must conform in order to participate 
      in an EODiSP simulation. When this is not the case (simulation package <b>D</b> in 
      the figure), a wrapper is used.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EODiSP framework is implemented as the HLA <i>Runtime Infrastructure</i> (RTI). 
      The RTI is a component defined by the HLA that provides the generic infrastructure 
      for an HLA simulation. It in particular keeps track of all attributes that are published 
      by all federates in a simulation and is responsible for notifying registered federates 
      whenever an attribute's value is updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      As indicated in the figure, two categories of federates can be recognized. The first 
      category are the user-defined federates. These are the federates that encapsulate 
      the simulation packages provided by the user. These federates are normally specific 
      to a particular simulation and must be entirely defined by the user. The second category 
      are federates that are pre-defined by the EODiSP. These federates are the same in 
      all EODiSP simulations and are provided with the EODiSP environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two pre-defined federates in an EODiSP simulation. The first one implements 
      the <i>management object model</i> or MOM. The MOM is defined by the HLA standard. 
      It is intended to make available to other federates information about a running federation. 
      For this purpose, it publishes attributes that define items like: the number of federates 
      that have currently joined the federation, the current version of the RTI, the host 
      on which a certain federate is running, the number of updates made by a certain federate, 
      etc. The MOM retrieves all this information from the RTI. The MOM can thus be seen 
      as the bridge between the RTI and the user-defined federates: it is the means through 
      which the user-defined federates can acquire internal RTI information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The functionalities to be implemented by the RTI and the MOM are fully defined by 
      the HLA. These functionalities represent a minimal core that must be provided by 
      all HLA-compliant simulation environments. The EODiSP, like most HLA-based simulation 
      environments, however, provides some additional functionalities. In keeping with 
      standard practice in the HLA community, the EODiSP implements them in a so-called 
      <i>control federate</i>. The <i>control federate</i> is the second pre-defined federate 
      provided by the EODiSP. Unlike the MOM, it is not defined by the HLA and its implementation 
      and interface are specific to the EODiSP. All EODiSP simulations must, however, include 
      it. In the EODiSP, the control federate is responsible for managing synchronization 
      points and interactions (see discussion of the <a href="#SimulationLifecycle">simulation lifecycle</a> 
      below) and for acting as a bridge between the simulation manager application (see 
      the discussion of the <a href="#EODiSPUserInterface">EODiSP user interface </a>) 
      and the simulation infrastructure.
    </p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="simulator_structure_HLA_view_1.png"><img border="0" src="images/simulator_structure_HLA_view_1.png" alt="Simulator Structure"></img></a><p>Figure 3: Simulator Structure</p></div>
    <p>
      The distribution part of the EODiSP is implemented within the RTI. The federates 
      see a local RTI interface and the RTI is responsible for routing attribute update 
      notifications over a distribution infrastructure. For this purpose, and as shown 
      in the next figure, the RTI is split into two kinds of components: the <i>Local RTI 
      Component</i> or LRC and the <i>Central RTI Component</i> or CRC. The LRC is a local 
      representative of the RTI that directly interfaces with a federate. The LRC's are 
      connected over a distribution infrastructure to the CRC that acts as a centralized 
      router.
    </p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="simulator_structure_HLA_view_2.png"><img border="0" src="images/simulator_structure_HLA_view_2.png" alt="Simulator Structure"></img></a><p>Figure 4: Simulator Structure</p></div>
    <p>
      As shown in the figure, the MOM federate has a special position. Instead of being 
      connected to an LRC, like all other federates, it is directly embedded within the 
      CRC. This is because the function of the MOM is to make available to other federates 
      information about the internal state of the CRC. It therefore makes sense to integrate 
      its federate tightly with the CRC. The other federates, however, see it as an ordinary 
      HLA federate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is useful to distinguish two types of communication channels within the 
      RTI. <i>Control channels</i> are established between an LRC's and the CRC. These 
      links are used to transfer typically short messages that describe changes in the 
      internal state of the LRC's or of the CRC. <i>Data channels</i> are instead used to 
      transfer potentially large amounts of data from one LRC to another. In order to avoid 
      cluttering, the figure only shows two such data channels (from federate <b>C</b> 
      to <b>D</b> and from federate <b>D</b> to <b>B</b>) but in reality whenever federate 
      X registers interest in an attribute owned by federate Y, then a data channel is 
      set up from Y to X since data will have to be transferred from Y to X. Thus data 
      transfers are designed to take the shortest route from the source of the data directly 
      to the user of the data, without having to go through the CRC.
    </p>
    <p>
      From an implementation point of view, it is important to point out that the EODiSP 
      runs each LRC-Federate pair in a dedicated Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The advantage 
      of this choice is that it isolates each federate in its own executable. This provides 
      a natural and effective fault tolerance for a simulation as a whole: if one federate 
      crashes, then no other federate needs be affected and the federation within which 
      the federate is embedded may in principle continue execution (albeit in a 
      degraded mode). The drawback of this choice is the overhead associated with starting 
      and running several JVMs on the same node. This overhead however is regarded as acceptable 
      in most practical situations where the number of federates running on the same node 
      is expected not to exceed 10-15.
    </p>
    <p> 
      There is another related implementation issue that may directly affect users of the EODiSP.
      This concerns the threading policy that is adopted by the EODiSP for updating federate
      attributes. Essentially, the behaviour of a federate in an EODiSP simulation is 
      driven by the arrival of notifications of updates of attribute values. Since the update
      notifications arrive asynchronously and the time required to process them varies
      from federate to federate (and, indeed, from attribute to attribute), the question arises 
      of how the update requests should be handled within the EODiSP.
    </p>
    <p>  
      The policy adopted in the EODiSP is best described with the help of the next figure.
      The figure shows a federate which subscribes to three attributes. As discussed above,
      the federate receives the update notifications through the LRC and the LRC runs as a 
      self-standing application on a dedicated JVM. Within this JVM, the EODiSP allocates 
      a dedicated thread to each new update request. All update request threads have the 
      same priority and they are configured to run to completion (the federate is encapsulated
      in a Java synchronized object). In other words, if
      an update request is received while a previous update request is still being processed,
      the later request is suspended. This ensures the integrity of the internal federate
      data. The model code will normally run in response to the update of certain attributes.
      This means that the model code will run on one of the update request threads. 
      To exemplify, and with reference to the figure, consider the case where the model code only
      runs when all three attributes have been updated. In such a case, the model code would
      run on the thread that is associated to the attribute that is updated last.

    <p>
      The EODiSP is operated through two GUI-based applications: the <i>simulation manager</i> 
      and the <i>model manager</i>. The simulation manager can only be instantiated once
      for each simulation. 
      It controls the simulation environment (the HLA RTI) and acts 
      as the simulation server. The model manager application is instantiated at least 
      once for every distribution node that participates in a simulation. A model manager 
      application controls a set of simulation packages encapsulated in HLA federates that 
      reside on the same node. The model managers act as clients to the simulation manager 
      server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two categories of users participate in an EODiSP simulation. The first type of user 
      is the <i>simulation owner</i>. This is the person who is in overall control of a 
      complete simulation. The simulation owner decides how the simulation packages encapsulating 
      the simulation models should be configured and when a simulation should start and 
      terminate. The simulation owner interacts with the EODiSP through the simulation 
      manager application.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second type of user is the <i>model owner</i>. The model owner is a person in 
      charge of one or more simulation models. The model owner decides when to make his 
      simulation models available to a simulation and when to terminate their availability. 
      The model owner interacts with the EODiSP through a model manager application.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposed operational concept is illustrated in the figure below for a distributed 
      case. In the case illustrated in the figure, a simulation requires five models. Models 
      A1 and A2 reside on a remote node (node 1 in the figure) and belong to model owner 
      A. Model B1 resides on the same remote node but belongs to a different model owner 
      B. Models C1 and C2 reside on the same node on which the simulation environment resides 
      (node 2 in the figure) and belong to model owner C. In such a configuration, three 
      model manager applications need to be active when the simulation manager application 
      is started. In the figure, the applications are indicated as green boxes and the 
      simulation models are indicated as yellow boxes.

  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="EODiSPRepository"></a><h2>EODiSP Repository</h2>
    <p>
       The implementation of the concept outlined above requires the availability of
       a centralized repository where all 
       models (suitably wrapped as HLA federates) that may take part in a simulation 
       are registered. This repository is called the <i>EODiSP Repository</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
       The registration of a model in the repository is done through the model manager
       application. The simulation manager application inspects the repository to check 
       whether the models that are required for a given simulation are indeed available
       and to find information about their location.
    </p>
    <p>
       The EODiSP can operate in two basic modes. In <i>remote mode</i>, one or more 
       of the simulation 
       models are located on a remote node (with respect to the simulation manager application). 
       In <i>local mode</i>, all the simulation models are located on the same platform as the 
       simulation manager application. Operation in remote mode requires the repository to be 
       installed on a publicly accessible server. Operation in local mode requires the repository 
       to be installed locally on the same machine on which the simulation models and the 
       simulation manager application are located. 
    </p>
    <p>  
       The EODiSP provides an application, the <i>repository manager application</i> to control
       the configuration and creation of an EODiSP repository.   
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="TypicalUsageScenario"></a><h2>Typical Usage Scenario</h2>
    <p>
      In the EODiSP concept, simulation models are encapsulated in simulation packages 
      that exist independently of the simulation infrastructure. The first logical step 
      towards the creation of a simulation is taken when model owners who are prepared 
      to allow their simulation models to be used start the model manager GUI application 
      on their node. They then register their models with the EODiSP repository. The 
      information in the repository consists uniquely of a description of the external interfaces 
      of the models. The model code remains under the complete control of the model owners. 
      After the registration process is complete, the model manager remains in listening 
      mode, waiting for a simulation manager application to request it to join in a simulation. 
      The model owner can at any time withdraw his models from a simulation through the 
      model manager GUI application. This mechanism thus ensures that model owners remain 
      in control of their models. This is important in view of the fact that an EODiSP 
      simulation may be made up of a collection of models that belong to different individuals 
      or organisations that may be unwilling to hand over control over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simulation owner controls a simulation through the simulation manager GUI application. 
      He performs a simulation in three basic steps. In the first step, the simulation 
      owner defines the simulation configuration by defining which simulation models participate 
      in a simulation experiment, and how many and which simulation runs should be performed. 
      The simulation owner has access to the EODiSP repository and can browse it to identify 
      the models that are of interest to him. In the second step, the simulation owner 
      starts the configured simulation experiment. In the third step, the simulation manager 
      application identifies the model manager applications that give access to the 
      simulation models required for the simulation and, if it finds them, starts execution 
      of the simulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In principle, a simulation experiment, once it is started, will autonomously continue 
      until all the simulation runs defined in the experiment have terminated. However, 
      the EODiSP GUI also gives the simulation owner control over a running simulation. 
      In particular, the simulation owner can ask for a running simulation to be held and 
      it can ask for a simulation to execute in step-by-step mode. These facilities may 
      be especially useful for debugging purposes.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="SimulationLifecycle"></a><h2>Simulation Lifecycle</h2>
    <p>
      The lifecycle of an EODiSP simulation (or, more precisely, of an EODiSP HLA 
      federation) is marked by five events:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>EODISP_START</i>: this event marks the start of a simulation. It is reached when
        all federates in a federation have completed their attribute publication and
        subscription process. After the EODiSP_START event has been reached,
        the simulation 
        starts in the sense that the simulation federates begin to update the attributes they publish and 
        begin to process notifications of updates to the attributes they subscribe to. </li>
      <li><i>EODISP_PAUSE</i>: this event changes the state of the simulation from 'running' 
        to 'paused'. When a simulation is paused, the data flow between federates is temporarily 
        suspended. A pause facility may be useful for debugging purposes or to allow simulation 
        model maintenance during a simulation run. Pausing is implemented by building into 
        one or more federates the ability to suspend the update of the attributes they publish.</li>
      <li><i>EODISP_STEP</i>: this event causes the execution of a paused simulation to advance 
        of one step. The models that have suspended the update of the attributes they publish, 
        release them but only once.</li>
      <li><i>EODISP_RESUME</i>: this event changes the state of the simulation from 'paused' 
        to 'running'. The models that have suspended the update of the attributes they publish, 
        release them.</li>
      <li><i>EODISP_STOP</i>: this event marks the end of a simulation. When a simulation stops, 
        all federates cease to update the attributes they publish and resign from the federation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The first four events occur in response to requests made by the simulation manager 
      through the simulation manager application. The last event - the simulation stop 
      - occurs as a result of the evolution of the internal state of one or more federates 
      participating in a simulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lifecycle events introduced above are managed through HLA synchronization points
      and HLA interactions.
    <p>
    </p>  
      Synchronization points are a mechanism defined by the HLA to coordinates the actions 
      of federates in a simulation. Generally speaking, synchronization points 
      in HLA work as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The control federate registers a synchronization point for a group of federates, 
        called the <i>synchronization group</i>.</li>
      <li>The RTI announces this newly registered synchronization point to all federates in 
        the synchronization group.</li>
      <li>Each federate of the synchronization group informs the RTI when it reaches the synchronization 
        point (after receiving the synchronization point announcement).</li>
      <li>The RTI informs all federates in the synchronization group that the synchronization 
        point is achieved as soon as all 
        federates have informed the RTI that they achieved it. At this point the federation is
        synchronized.</li>
      <li>The synchronization point is removed from the RTI.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The EODiSP predefines five synchronization points, one for each of the five 
      events described above. Additional synchronization points may of course be defined for
      a particular simulation. Federates announce their intention to be included in a synchronization 
      group in the SOM.
     </p> 
     <p> 
      Interactions are a mechanism defined by the HLA to allow a federate to perform an action
      or transfer some data to other federates in a federation. The EODiSP predefines one
      interaction. This is used in the initialization phase (i.e. before the EODiSP_START
      synchronization point has been achieved) to allow each federate to send a handle that uniquely
      identifes it to the control federate. Additional interactions may of course be defined
      for a particular simulation. Federates declare their interactions in the SOM.

    <p>
      The EODiSP is provided with a demonstrator which is intended to verify its correct implementation
      and to serve as a blueprint of how a simulator can be set up
      as an instantiation of the EODiSP. The EODiSP demonstrator is described in a
