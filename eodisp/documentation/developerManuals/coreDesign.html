      This page describes the design of the EODiSP core software package. For a better 
      understanding, it is recommended to read the <a href="coreArchitecture.html">EODiSP 
      core architecture</a> page first. Additionally, this document is best read in combination 
      with the <a href="coreJavadoc/index.html">EODiSP core API documentation</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The EODiSP core is split into three components: the <i>simulation manager application</i>, 
      the <i>model manager application</i> and the <i>model repository</i>. The next sections 
      provide an overview of the design of these components.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="Repository"></a><h2>Repository</h2>
    <p>
      The model repository is a central place that stores information shared by the simulation 
      manager and the model managers. The repository makes this information available through 
      the <a href="coreJavadoc/org/eodisp/core/common/ReposModelService.html">ReposModelService</a> 
      interface (the remote interface is made available to clients by a remote object 
      exported through <a href="remoteDesign.html">EODiSP remote</a>). It is essential 
      and necessary that both the simulation manager and the model manager applications 
      have a connection to a repository in order to function properly. Since these two 
      applications can be run in local mode (i.e. without any network connection), the 
      model repository application can also be installed locally on the computer where a simulation 
      will eventually be running.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data in the repository is stored in an XML file. This was chosen because all 
      persistent data in the EODiSP framework are stored in this way. It has the advantage 
      of not adding additional dependencies to the application. The data model of the repository 
      is shown as a UML class diagram in Figure 1.
    </p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="core-repository.png"><img border="0" src="../../images/core-repository.png" alt="Data stored with the model repository application."></img></a><p>Figure 1: Data stored with the model repository application.</p></div>
    <p>
      The <i>Repository</i> class serves as the root object from which all other objects 
      are reachable. First, the Repository stores <i>Categories</i> and 
      <a href="../../glossary.html#SOM"><i>SOM</i>'s</a>. 
      A Category can be used to categorize different projects (e.g. an EarthCARE simulation 
      could be a category that would hold all models that are relevant to the EarthCARE
      simulation). This is useful for repository clients which are interested 
      in only one ore some categories, since it limits the amount of data to be transfered. 
      The categorization is done upon the SOM objects, hence the link from the Category 
      to the SOM object. The back reference (the link from the SOM object to the Category 
      object) is used in order to allow a SOM to participate in multiple Categories without 
      redefining or copying the SOM.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SOM object itself links to federates whose implementation conform to the specification 
      in the SOM. The Federate object references objects with information such as the model 
      manager application it will run on or the init declaration data it expects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the repository stores a unique Id for each model manager (<i>ModelManager</i> 
      class) and simulation manager (<i>SimManager</i> class) application. These Id's will 
      be stored as soon as an application registers itself with the repository. Repository 
      clients do not store any information about the manager applications but hold only 
      a reference in form of this Id. This, again, limits the need for data updates in 
      case the information changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      All data that are stored in the model repository should not be duplicated in another 
      application to avoid update conflicts in case of changes. This is the reason why 
      an EODiSP application can only work together with a functional model repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data that is stored in the repository needs to be transferred over the network 
      to repository clients (in the case of the EODiSP, this will be at least the simulation 
      manager and the model manager applications). This is a common requirement in distributed 
      applications or frameworks and it requires the objects to be transferred to be serializable. 
      One option would be to write these objects manually. For the model repository, however, 
      an existing solution has been chosen. The solution is called Service Data Objects 
      (SDO). It is implemented as a thin layer on top of EMF, which is used to manage 
      the XML data store of the repository. SDO in combination with EMF is capable of creating 
      so called data graphs from an XML data store such as the one used in the model repository. 
      These data graphs can be serialized and sent over the network. The form of a serialized 
      data graph is itself XML. The transferred data graph can be used on the client side 
      to perform changes. All these changes are recorded within the data graph in order 
      to be sent them back to the model repository. The model repository will inspect the 
      changes made by the client and commit them to the actual XML data store.
    </p>
    <p>
      SDO is a specification from IBM. Its documentation is available at 
      <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/specification/j-commonj-sdowmt/index.html" class="external">SDO 
      specification</a>. It has a defined set of interfaces that allow a client to operate 
      on a data graph in a generic way. This means that the client does not need to know where 
      the data represented by the data graph is coming from. The client always operates on the 
      same interfaces. This, in principle, would allow the model repository to change its 
      storage back-end to something else than XML (e.g. a relational database).
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="SimulationManager"></a><h2>Simulation Manager</h2>
    <p>
      The simulation manager application consists of a core and a GUI part. Here, only 
      the core part is described, the GUI part has its own <a href="guiDesign.html">documentation 
      section</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The core part of the simulation manager application is used mainly to encapsulate 
      common, not GUI-related functionalities into separate packages. Thus, it provides services 
      to work with the repository and to manipulate their own model data. This separation 
      would make it possible to replace the whole GUI implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the data on the repository, the simulation manager application stores 
      some local data. The UML class diagram in the next figure shows its data model.
    </p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="core-smproject.png"><img border="0" src="../../images/core-smproject.png" alt="Data stored by the simulation manager application."></img></a><p>Figure 2: Data stored by the simulation manager application.</p></div>
    <p>
      The <i>SmProject</i> serves as the root class. It contains objects of two classes; 
      Simulation experiments (<i>Experiments</i> object) and federations (<i>Federations</i> 
      object). As mentioned above, the simulation manager application does not locally 
      store information that is available from a repository. It does, however, store a 
      remote Id of the object it references. This remote Id is of the form of a <a href="../../glossary.html#EMF">UUID</a> 
      and can be used to retrieve a referenced object (with its data) from the repository. 
      In the case of the simulation manager application, two objects store such a remote 
      Id, the <i>LocalFederate</i> object, which is a reference to a <i>Federate</i> object 
      in the repository, and the <i>LocalInitDecl</i> object, which is a reference to a 
      <i>InitDecl</i> object in the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simulation manager core package implementation can be used through interfaces 
      that expose the functionality of the application. For instance, the simulation manager 
      application GUI uses this interface to retrieve data from the repository, to start 
      a simulation experiment, etc. Two interfaces are defined for this purpose:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interface for the simulation manager core functionality. This includes functions 
        such as start an simulation experiment, connect to the repository, etc. This interface 
        is described in the Javadoc documentation available at: 
        <a href="coreJavadoc/org/eodisp/core/sm/service/SmCoreService.html">SmCoreService</a>. 
        This interface is only available locally, i.e. it is not exported by the EODiSP remote 
        package.</li>
      <li>Interface to work with the project model of the simulation manager application. Hence, 
        this is the access code for the data illustrated in Figure 2 above. This interface 
        is described in the Javadoc documentation available at: <a href="coreJavadoc/org/eodisp/core/sm/service/SmModelService.html">SmModelService</a>. 
        This interface is only available locally, i.e. it is not exported by the EODiSP remote 
        package.</li>
    </ul>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="ModelManager"></a><h2>Model Manager</h2>
    <p>
      From a design point of view, the model manager application is very similar to the 
      simulation manager application described in the previous section. It also consists of 
      a core and a GUI component, and again, only the core part is described here. The GUI part 
      has its own <a href="guiDesign.html">documentation section</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The model manager has some data that it stores locally. This is illustrated in the 
      UML class diagram in the next figure.
    </p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="core-mmproject.png"><img border="0" src="../../images/core-mmproject.png" alt="Data model of the the model manager application."></img></a><p>Figure 3: Data model of the the model manager application.</p></div>
    <p>
      The root object is the <i>MmProject</i>. It contains <i>LocalSOM</i> and <i>LocalFederate</i> 
      objects with associated data. Unlike the simulation manager application, some data 
      are stored locally <i>and</i> remotely on the repository. This is true for the name 
      and description attribute of the <i>LocalFederate</i> object and the description 
      attribute of the <i>LocalSOM</i> object. The reason to store this informations on 
      both nodes is to avoid the situation where a model manager cannot connect to a repository 
      and thus looses the informations about a Federate or SOM it actually owns. This data 
      replication is however not critical because only one model manager (the owning one) 
      can update this informations on the repository. Therefore, no update conflicts will 
      occur. On the other hand, it makes it possible to register federates or SOM's in 
      more than one repository without rewriting all the information.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the connection to the repository, the model manager serves  
      as a remote component for the simulation manager. This is described in the core architecture 
      documentation at <a href="coreArchitecture.html">Core Architecture</a>. This interface 
      is defined in the EODiSP core package and is exported by using the facilities provided 
      by the EODiSP remote package. The interface is described in the Javadoc documentation 
      available at <a href="coreJavadoc/org/eodisp/core/common/ModelManagerRemote.html">ModelManagerRemote</a>. 
      It provides methods to start and stop a federate on the model manager.
