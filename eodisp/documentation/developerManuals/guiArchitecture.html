    This page describes the architecture of the 
    <a href="generalArchitecture.html#EODiSPGUIApplications">EODiSP GUI applications</a>, the 
    <i>simulation manager application</i> and the <i>model manager application</i>.
    The two GUI applications are built as the instantiation of a framework which is referred to
    as the <i>EODiSP 
    GUI base framework</i>.

    <p>
      The EODiSP GUI package consists of two independent applications. The first is the 
      simulation manager application, the second is the model manager application. The 
      purpose of the simulation manager application is to let a user - the simulation owner 
      - control the simulation experiment. The purpose of the model manager application 
      is to let a user - the model owner - control which of his owned model can participate 
      in which simulations. The implementation of this functionality is mostly done in 
      the <a href="./coreArchitecture.html">EODiSP core</a> software package. The GUI applications 
      provide just a graphical interface to this implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though most of the functional requirements are covered in the EODiSP core implementation, 
      some functionality is directly incorporated in the GUI applications. The most essential 
      functionality is the ability to manage the respective project file. This project 
      file, depending on the application, serves a different purpose:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The simulation manager's project file handles the creation and the management of 
        federations and simulation experiments.</li>
      <li>The model manager's project file handles the management of the federates.</li>
    </ul>
    These project files are stored as XML documents. The manipulation of these files 
    is done through the use of the
  
    <a href="#TheGUIandEMF">EMF framework</a>.
    <p>
      Apart from manipulating the project files, the GUI applications are used to control 
      the core application. All the functionality (such as starting and stopping a simulation, 
      step-by-step simulation mode, etc.) provided by the core application can be accessed. 
      It is also possible to monitor a currently running simulation. The monitoring facility 
      of the simulation manager application provides informations about the current state 
      of a running simulation, whereas the monitoring facility of the model manager provides 
      information about the participation state of a specific model in a currently running 
      simulation.
    </p>
    <div class="subsection"><a name="TheGUIandEMF"></a><h3>The GUI and EMF</h3>
      <p>
        Since the crucial feature of an EODiSP GUI application is the manipulation of its 
        project file, the implementation for manipulating XML files is also crucial. Instead 
        of implementing an own mechanism for XML manipulation, the EODiSP assigns this task 
        to the <a class="external" href="http://www.eclipse.org/emf/">EMF framework</a>. 
        EMF is a code generation facility for building tools based on a structured data model, 
        such as XML. Therefore, it is well suited for this task. The code generated by EMF 
        is split into three parts:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The model code: This code is a representation of the actual model (i.e. the XML file).</li>
        <li>The edit code: This code is built on top of the model code and facilitates the manipulation 
          of the model by providing commands such as insert object, delete object, undo and 
          redo commands, etc.</li>
        <li>The editor code: This code generates either an eclipse plug-in or a rich client application. 
          It is built on top of the edit code and provides a complete solution to edit the 
          model in a graphical environment.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This possibilities are tempting, and in fact, the EODiSP uses the first two parts 
        of the above mentioned list, the model and the edit code, to manipulate the XML data. 
        The third part of the EMF generation process, however, is not used by the EODiSP 
        GUI. This stems from the fact that one requirement for the EODiSP is, that it shall 
        run under as many platforms as possible. The problem with this requirement and the 
        generated EMF editor code is, that it depends on the eclipse platform, which is not 
        platform independent. As a matter of fact, the eclipse platform runs on many platforms, 
        but the decision has been taken to use pure Java for the implementation of the EODiSP, 
        which runs on even more platforms. As a consequence, the decision felt on using Java 
        Swing for the implementation of the EODiSP GUI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Figure 1 shows the connection between the Java Swing and the EMF framework. It shows 
        that the EODiSP uses the model code and the edit code generated by the EMF framework. 
        The editor code, however, cannot be used because it does not use the Swing graphic 
        library, but the SWT library instead. For the reasons mentioned above, the EODiSP 
        privileges the Swing graphic library. Since the interface of the SWT components and 
        the Swing components are different and because EMF provides code generation for the 
        SWT library only, there arises the need to wrap the generated EMF code to make it 
        usable for the Swing library. This is done in the EODiSP model code. It uses the 
        generated EMF code to access the actual model data. It then transforms this data 
        and exposes an interface to the transformed data which is usable by the swing components.

    <div class="subsection"><a name="BaseFramework"></a><h3>Base Framework</h3>
      <p>
        Since many design considerations are very similar for each and every GUI application, 
        the two EODiSP applications are instantiated from a base GUI framework that has been 
        developed for the EODiSP. The base framework has been implemented from scratch and 
        is a lightweight implementation following a slightly modified version of the <a href="#TheMVCPattern">MVC 
        pattern</a>. The decision not to use an existing GUI framework for the EODiSP has 
        been made in order to have a framework that has as few dependencies as possible and 
        to exactly reflect the needs for the EODiSP at the same time.
      </p>

    <p></p>
    <div class="subsection"><a name="TheMVCPattern"></a><h3>The MVC Pattern</h3>
      <p>
        The Model-View-Controller pattern is a widely used pattern in GUI frameworks and 
        envisages three main components; The model, the controller and the views. It is used 
        to separate an application's data model, user interface and control logic into three 
        distinct components. The three main components can be described as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The model: A domain specific representation of information. The information itself 
          is usually stored persistently (e.g. in a database or in a file). The model adds 
          meaning to this data by providing mechanism to work with it.</li>
        <li>The view: This is the component that presents the data held by the model to the user. 
          This is typically a user interface element. Several views can access the same model 
          data and represent it.</li>
        <li>The controller: This is the component that receives events (such as a click on a 
          menu item) and processes them. It invokes changes on the model, and sometimes also 
          on the view.</li>
      </ul>
      Figure 2 illustrates the MVC pattern with the main components and their interactions.
    
      <div class="figure"><a name="./mvc-original.png"><img border="0" src="../../images/./mvc-original.png" alt="The original Model-View-Controller Pattern"></img></a><p>Figure 2: The original Model-View-Controller Pattern</p></div>
      <p>
        Using this architecture to build a GUI framework assures that the components are 
        decoupled. It is also a good architecture to ensure maintainability of the code even 
        if the code base grows.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection"><a name="TheMVCPatternadaptedfortheEODiSPGUI"></a><h3>The MVC Pattern adapted for the EODiSP GUI</h3>
      <p>
        The EODiSP GUI framework is implemented on the basis of a slightly modified MVC architecture. 
        The difference is only in the view component, where an additional component has been 
        added. This additional component is the frame.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea behind a frame is, that it is a container for several views. It is able 
        to manage these views independently, releasing the controller component from this 
        task. The functionality of a frame can be summarized as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is a container for several views.</li>
        <li>It can set, unset, or change the currently active view.</li>
        <li>It knows how to display a view component.</li>
        <li>It defines the overall look and feel.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hence, the frame is actually the view component in the sense of the original MVC 
        architecture. Therefore, the addition would rather be that the view component has 
        been degraded to be only a component that can display data from the model. As an 
        analogy, the frame can be considered as a picture's frame, whereas the view would 
        be the picture itself. Since it is a modern picture frame, the picture in the frame 
        can be replaced by another picture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using frames as containers for views creates new possibilities. For instance, a view 
        can be displayed in another frame without much work, or if a frame is disposed, it 
        will dispose all included views automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        Figure 3 shows the structure of the MVC architecture as it is used in the EODiSP 
        GUI base framework. Apart from the frame component which has been added, it is identical 
        to the original MVC pattern.
      </p>
      <div class="figure"><a name="./mvc-eodisp.png"><img border="0" src="../../images/./mvc-eodisp.png" alt="The Model-View-Controller Pattern as it has been adapted for the EODiSP"></img></a><p>Figure 3: The Model-View-Controller Pattern as it has been adapted for the EODiSP</p></div>
      <p>
        It should be noted that this architecture allows a controller to send commands directly 
        to a view. This can be useful in some situations (e.g. to send a command to update 
        the registered actions). However, whenever a command involves the view's model, it 
        is considered as a more structured way if controllers send their command only to 
        the models, which in turn update the views by sending a notification.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection"><a name="InteractionswiththeUser"></a><h3>Interactions with the User</h3>
      <p>
        Another important feature of a GUI application are the interactions with the user. 
        For the EODiSP GUI, these interactions are mostly done through actions. Actions can 
        appear as a menu bar item, a tool bar item, or as an entry in the context menu. In 
        this documentation, we will refer to all of these item as the interaction interface. 
        Apart from actions, obvious interaction components such as text boxes, etc. are also 
        supported. Because the interesting part are the actions, they are described here 
        a bit more detailed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actions are a Java Swing construct which can be used to define centralized control 
        of functionality. Hence, actions can be used to create an item in an interaction 
        interface with only one instance of an action. For instance, an action can declare 
        an "OnExit" functionality, which is available from the menu bar and the tool bar. 
        Whenever the action is performed, the same code will be executed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Handling these actions is quite a large task for a GUI application. For this reason, 
        the EODiSP GUI base framework has a built-in lightweight interaction interface management. 
        It is described in more detail in the <a href="./guiDesign.html#Actions">Actions 
        section of the GUI Design page</a>
