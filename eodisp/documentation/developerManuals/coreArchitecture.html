      <p>
        The core package provides an implementation of two manager applications - the <i>simulation 
        manager application</i> and the <i>model manager application</i>. The primary purpose of the two manager 
        applications is to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Control the HLA implementation, and</li>
        <li>Extend the functionality provided by the HLA implementation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The need to extend the functionality of the HLA stems from the fact that not all 
        requirements for the EODiSP can be covered by the HLA implementation. In order to 
        keep the HLA part of the EODiSP implementation compliant to the HLA standard, all 
        these non-HLA requirements are implemented in the two manager applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Requirements that are not covered by the HLA are, for instance, a facility to remotely 
        start and stop a federate, setting a simulation to a hold state, etc. In order to 
        be able to fulfill these requirements, the two manager applications need to be able 
        to directly exchange data. Therefore, the EODiSP remote package is not only needed 
        on the level of the HLA, but also on the level of the manager applications. Figure 
        1 illustrates the connection between the two manager applications. In addition to 
        extending the functionality, the other purpose of the manager applications is to 
        control the HLA implementation. This is, for instance, to start the RTI, add federates 
        to a simulation, retrieve informations about a running simulation, etc. These functionalities 
        is covered directly on the level of the HLA.
      </p>
      <div class="figure"><a name="package-manager-applications.png"><img border="0" src="../../images/package-manager-applications.png" alt="Architecture of the manager applications"></img></a><p>Figure 1: Architecture of the manager applications</p></div>
      <p>
        The figure shows how the two manager applications are connected. Another important 
        point that the figure illustrates are the virtual machines in which the applications 
        run. As illustrated in the figure, the simulation and the model manager applications 
        run in different virtual 
        machines. These virtual machines could be located on one physical computer 
        or on different computers. The EODiSP remote package works in both situations 
        transparently.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two manager applications do not implement any GUI-based functionality. The GUI
        part of the simulation and model managers are implemented in a separate software
        package (<a href="guiArchitecture.html">EODiSP GUI package</a>). 
        To each manager application, a GUI application is
        associated. Thus, to the simulation manager application, a GUI simulation
        manager application is associated and to each model manager application, a dedicated
        GUI model manager application is associated.
        </p>
      <p>
        An important point to note is that the manager applications and their associated
        GUI implementations 
        run in the same virtual machine. Since the EODiSP does not include a requirements 
        to physically separate the GUI from the core implementation, this architecture is 
        more effective. However, some data must be accessible to both, the GUI and the core 
        implementation. In this situations, access blocks (indicated by dark green boxes 
        in the figure) are created. All of these access blocks expose a well defined interface 
        with which both the GUI and manager applications can work. This has been chosen as 
        a baseline architecture since it is regarded as more effective, especially from the
        point of view of the 
        GUI implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        As indicated in the figure, the simulation manager application can exchange data 
        with the model manager application through a well defined interface, the 'Model Manager 
        Remote API'. On the other side, the model manager application can exchange data with 
        the simulation manager application through the 'Simulation Manager Remote API'.
      </p>
      <p>
        As already mentioned, the manager applications do not have a graphical user interface 
        but provide a management 
        interface built on top of JMX. The manager applications are configurable and manageable 
        by using this interface. However, a graphical user interface in Java Swing is implemented 
        separately in the <a href="guiArchitecture.html">EODiSP GUI</a> software package.
      </p>
    <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="Repository"></a><h2>Repository</h2>
      <p>
        The model repository provides a facility to keep track of the simulation models (encapsulated
        as HLA federates) that have already been created and that are potentially available for inclusion
        in an EODiSP simulation. The repository also allow the model managers (the 'owners' of the
        simulation models) to restrict access to the their models to selected simulation managers.
        </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the application, the repository serves 
        different purposes. For the simulation manager, these are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Registering/unregistering itself in the repository as a simulation manager.</li>
        <li>Retrieving a list of all registered federates in order to integrate them in a simulation.</li>
        <li>Validate the federates and their interconnections for a particular simulation prior 
          to starting a simulation experiment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And for the model manager:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Register/unregister the federates that are integrated in the model manager application 
          as being available.</li>
        <li>Retrieving a list of simulation manager applications in order to restrict access 
          to the federates.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Having such a repository has many advantages. The most prominent advantage is that 
        a simulation manager can access information about federates even if they are not 
        running. The only thing that needs to run and also needs to be accessible is the 
        repository itself. This means that the repository needs to run on a machine that is publicly 
        accessible. The next figure shows how the repository is accessed by the different applications.
      </p>
      <div class="figure"><a name="core-repository-access.png"><img border="0" src="../../images/core-repository-access.png" alt="Access to the repository"></img></a><p>Figure 2: Access to the repository</p></div>
      <p>
        Since both the manager applications and the GUI need to access the repository, a 
        separate access block is implemented (the 'Repository Access'). This access code 
        belongs to the core package implementation but exposes an interface which also the 
        GUI can work with. As shown in the figure, all three components run in a different 
        virtual machine. This usually means that they run on physically separated machines. 
        But again, it is also possible to run them on a single machine.
