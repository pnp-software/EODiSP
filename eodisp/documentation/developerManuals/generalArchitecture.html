      This page describes the overall architecture of the EODiSP. The intention is to give 
      a description of what each of the EODiSP software package does and how these software 
      packages interact and work together. This description is fairly high-level. Please 
      refer to the documentation of each software package for a more detailed description 
      of its architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EODiSP software packages are also referred to as EODiSP applications. This is 
      because each EODiSP software package is an EODiSP application. In general, in this 
      page, the term 'EODiSP' is used to refer to the set of applications that are required 
      to configure and run a simulation. The EODiSP environment also provides a set of 
      so-called 'support applications'. The support applications are intended to help users 
      perform off-line tasks that are required prior to running a simulation (such as the 
      generation of wrappers to transform generic simulation packages into HLA-compliant 
      models ready to be integrated in the EODiSP) or after a simulation as terminated 
      (such as post-processing of simulation data). This page does not document the support 
      applications which are instead covered in a <a href="supportApplications.html">dedicated 
      page</a>.

    <p>
      The EODiSP project consists of five major software packages. These software packages 
      encapsulate major EODiSP functionalities and are
      intended to be decoupled from each other. The five software packages are: the <i>EODiSP core</i>, 
      the <i>EODiSP 
      HLA</i>, the <i>EODiSP remote</i>, the <i>EODiSP GUI</i>, and a package defining a set of 
      <i>wrapper applications</i>. In addition, 
      an EODiSP <i>utility package</i> is provided. This latter package is not regarded as a major software 
      package since it implements low-level common tasks for all other software packages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first three packages - the core package, the HLA package, and the remote package -
      implement the <i>EODiSP core framework</i>. The GUI package and the wrapper package are support packages
      that facilitate the use of the 
      EODiSP framework, but would, technically speaking, not be necessary. The figure shows 
      all these packages and how they depend on each other.
    </p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="package-dependencies.png"><img border="0" src="../../images/package-dependencies.png" alt="Structure of a Simulator Instantiated from the EODiSP"></img></a><p>Figure 1: Structure of a Simulator Instantiated from the EODiSP</p></div>
    <p>
      The arrow in the figure indicate that a package uses or controls another one. The arrows 
      should not be taken to mean that the data flow is uni-directional. It will be noted that all packages can 
      make use of the utility package which includes an implementation of common code implementing
      low level functionalities like 
      configuration, data conversions, etc.
    </p>
    <p>These packages are described in the following sections.</p>
    <div class="subsection"><a name="EODiSPCoreFramework"></a><h3>EODiSP Core Framework</h3>
      <p>
        As mentioned earlier, the core framework of the EODiSP consists of three packages 
        - the core package, the HLA package and the remote package. These three packages are kept
        separate because they implement logically distinct functionalities and because there may be
        a desire to use them independently of each other or to replace them within the EODiSP. 
      </p>
      <div class="subsubsection"><a name="EODiSPHLA"></a><h4>EODiSP HLA</h4>
        <p>
          The EODiSP is built as an implementation of the <a class="external" href="https://www.dmso.mil/public/public/transition/hla/">High-Level 
          Architecture</a> (HLA). The HLA is the most widely used simulation architecture and 
          is formally defined in the IEEE standard 1516. Adherence to the standard allows interoperability 
          and reusability of simulation models. The HLA is a modular architecture. It is defined 
          as a bundle of services that support various aspects of a simulation. In general, 
          a particular simulator will only need a subset of all the services defined by the 
          HLA. The set of services supported by the EODiSP is defined on the <a href="./implementedHLAServices.html">HLA 
          Services</a> page. The selection of the services was done keeping in mind the intended 
          usage of the EODiSP as a platform for earth observation end-to-end mission simulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          the advantage of providing a dedicated HLA package is that, at least in principle, it gives developers the option to
          use this package sepaately from the other EODiSP packages as a self-standing implementation
          of the HLA standard. It also gives the option to developers to replace the HLA implementation
          provided with the EODiSP and to use an alternative HLA implementation.
        </p>
        <p>  
          As shown in the figure above, the HLA package uses the EODiSP remote package which implements 
          the network infrastructure part of the EODiSP. Note that the HLA standard does not specify a network 
          infrastructure for the HLA. Also for this reason, the network infrastructure for the EODiSP is
          implemented in a dedicated package leaving again open the option to replace it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The HLA implementation is the central part of the EODiSP, since all other packages 
          are built around it. It in particular specifies the interfaces to which simulation models 
          must comply. Furthermore, it implicitly defines the minimal features supported by 
          the EODiSP. 
         </p>
        <p>
          The implementation of the HLA services in the HLA package is split into a CRC (Central RTI Component) 
          and a LRC (Local RTI Component). See the <a href="./hlaArchitecture.html">HLA Architecture</a> 
          for more detailed description.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsubsection"><a name="EODiSPCore"></a><h4>EODiSP Core</h4>
        <p>This is the non-HLA part of the core of the EODiSP framework. Its purpose is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To control the HLA implementation, and</li>
          <li>To implement additional functionalities on top of the HLA implementation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The need for the former purpose is obvious since there must be a component which can control the 
          HLA functionality and which implement functions such as creating and managing a simulation. 
          The latter purpose 
          stems from the fact that not all requirements for the EODiSP can be covered by an 
          HLA implementation. For instance, the EODiSP needs to be able to find other applications 
          that participate in a currently running simulation. This - and other - functionalities cannot be covered
          at HLA level and are therefore provided by the core package.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that there is additional functionality on top of the HLA led to the decision 
          to decouple this package from the HLA implementation. Decoupling these two packages 
          has the further advantage that the HLA implementation remains a self-contained package 
          that complies to the HLA standard which can, at least potentially, be used separately
          from the EODiSP.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core package provides the code implementing three separate applications - the <i>simulation 
          manager application</i>, the <i>model manager application</i>, and the 
          <i>repository application</i>. The simulation manager and model manager applications are
          provided to allow a user to configure and control the execution of a simulation 
          (see the description of the <a href="../../overview.html#EODiSPUserInterface">EODiSP
          user interface</a>). Note that GUI-based front-end for these two applications is defined in
          the <a href="#EODiSPGuiApplications">GUI application package</a>. The repository application
          encapsulates and provides access to a centralized repository holding the description of all 
          the simulation models potentially accessible to the EODiSP users. 
         </p>
         <p>
          Additionally, the core package includes several modules that allow the simulation manager,
          model manager, and repository applications to exchange information and to control each other.
          Note that these three applications must be able to communicate with each other directly 
          without the HLA package. 
          This architecture is necessary because the simulation manager, model manager, and
          repository applications must provide functionalities on top of the HLA. 
          </p>
         <p>
          A detailed 
          explanation of the core package is given in the <a href="./coreArchitecture.html">EODiSP core 
          Architecture</a> documentation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsubsection"><a name="EODiSPRemote"></a><h4>EODiSP Remote</h4>
        <p>
          As its name suggests, this package is responsible for transferring simulation data 
          over a network. The network can be local, a LAN (local area network), or the Internet. 
          The remote package is built on top of a JXTA network infrastructure and implements 
          a remote method invocation mechanism (similar to the RMI implementation in Java). 
          Note that the JXTA infrastructure can be used to establish a connection between two nodes even 
          if they are behind a firewall or a NAT server. This allows the creation of distributed
          simulations where some of the simulation nodes are located behind firewalls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since both the core and the HLA packages can send data over a network, both packages 
          use the remote package. They do not have any network code directly integrated within them. This 
          also ensures that the remote package could, in principle, be replaced with another 
          package providing a different implementation of the networking infrastructure.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection"><a name="EODiSPGUIApplications"></a><h3>EODiSP GUI Applications</h3>
      <p>
        The EODiSP core application is operated through two 
        <a href="../../overview.html#EODiSPUserInterface">GUI applications</a>: 
        the simulation manager and the model manager applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        The simulation manager GUI can only be instantiated once. It controls the simulation 
        environment. The model manager GUI is instantiated at least once for every distribution 
        node that participates in a simulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A model manager application controls a set of simulation models (or HLA federates) 
        that reside on the same node. The model managers act as clients to the simulation 
        manager (the server).
      </p>
      <p>
        The two GUI applications work tightly together with the corresponding applications in 
        the <a href="">core package</a>. The GUI application and its counterpart in the core package
        run on the same node without any need for a remote connection 
        in order to communicate with each other. The communication between the two applications is 
        through the Java interfaces 
        that they expose. This implies that the simulation manager (from the EODiSP 
        core package) and the simulation manager GUI (from the EODiSP GUI package) cannot 
        run on different nodes. The same is true for the respective model manager applications. 
        In principle, it would be possible to separate these applications and let them run on different
        nodes but this would add considerable complexity and it was therefore decided to keep these
		applications tightly coupled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the functionality to run a simulation experiment is implemented in the core package
        application. The GUI applications are primarily aimed at providing an environment where
        the use can set up a simulation
        and control its execution. The two most important features of the GUI applications therefore
        are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To assemble a simulation experiment through a graphical user interface, and</li>
        <li>To control the core application through a graphical user interface</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The two GUI applications share certain common features and it is desirable they should have
        a similar look and feel. For this reason, a
        small GUI framework has been built as a common basis from which the two GUI applications
        are instantiated. This is described 
        in the <a href="./guiArchitecture.html">GUI Architecture</a> documentation.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection"><a name="EODiSPWrapperApplications"></a><h3>EODiSP Wrapper Applications</h3>
      <p>
        The HLA, among other things, defines the interface between the simulation models 
        and the simulation infrastructure (i.e. the EODiSP core). Hence, in order to be integrated 
        with the EODiSP core, simulation models must comply with an HLA interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        The EODiSP explicitly supports the concept of model wrappers. A wrapper is a piece 
        of code that transforms a given simulation model into an HLA-compliant model. The wrapper typically 
        changes the external interface of a model to make it comply with the HLA interface 
        requirements. Wrappers obviously depend on the structure of the model they wrap. 
        For this reason, it is not possible to provide a wrapper for every possible kind 
        of model.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the EODiSP recognizes that there are some types of models that are more likely 
        to occur in earth observation missions and, for these types of models, it provides 
        predefined wrappers. It additionally provide a number of 
        <a href="../developerManuals.html#supportApplications">support applications</a>
        that can automatically generate all or part of the wrappers. The EODiSP Wrapper Application
        package contains the code that implements the wrapper generators. Note that most of this 
        code is XSL-based rather than Java-based as for the rest of the EODiSP.
