      The EODiSP proper consists of the set of applications that are required to configure 
      and run a simulation. Typically, prior to running a simulation, a number of off-line 
      tasks need to be performed. Some of these tasks can be partially or fully automated. 
      A <i>support application</i> is an EODiSP-provided application that 
      helps users in performing these off-line tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The automatic generation of an <a href="../../overview.html">EODiSP wrapper</a> is
      a typical task that may be covered by a support application. This page accordingly
      gives an overview of the EODiSP wrapping approach and of how the wrapper generation
      process can be automated.
    </p>
    <p>     
      At present, only one support application is provided. This application is called the
      <i>HLA Wrapper Generator</i>. Its purpose is to automate
      the generation of the skeleton of an <a href="../../overview.html#Wrappers">EODiSP wrapper</a>.
      This page also gives an overview of this application.
    </p>

    <p>
      The EODiSP is intended to integrate <i>simulation packages</i>, namely pieces of 
      software that implement part of the functionalities required for a simulation run 
      and that are delivered as a single unit. The EODiSP provides an infrastructure to 
      connect together simulation packages and to allow them to interact with each other 
      to implement a complete simulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EODiSP is built as an implementation of the HLA standard. The HLA defines the 
      interface between the entities participating in a simulation (the <i>HLA federates</i>) 
      and the simulation infrastructure. Hence, in order to be integrated with the EODiSP 
      infrastructure, simulation packages must comply with this HLA interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unrealistic to expect all developers of simulation packages in the scientific 
      and engineering community to provide HLA-compliant packages. For this reason, the 
      EODiSP supports the concept of <i>wrapper</i>. A wrapper is a piece of code the transforms 
      a given simulation package into an HLA-compliant federate. The wrapper typically 
      adapts the external interface of a simulation package to make it comply with the 
      HLA requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrappers obviously depend on the structure of the model they wrap. For this reason, 
      it is not possible to provide a 'universal wrapper'. The skeleton of the wrapper -
      the part of the wrapper that interfaces to the EODiSP infrastructure - does however
      have a fixed structure. The EODiSP accordingly provides an application that can
      automatically generate this skeleton. This application is called the
      <i>HLA Wrapper Generator</i>. The generator takes as an
      input an XML-based description of the HLA interface of the target model and automatically
      generates the Java source code that implements the wrapper's skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>  
      Although it is not possible to define a fixed structure for a generic HLA wrapper, 
      it will often happen
      that wrappers that are targeted at similar models to be used in a certain simulator (or,
      perhaps, in a family of related simulators) do have a fixed structure. In such cases,
      it may be advantageous to develop a domain-specific wrapper generator.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to making simulation packages HLA-compliant, the EODiSP wrappers may 
      also serve a secondary purpose. In an HLA simulation, each simulation package <i>publishes</i> 
      its outputs and it <i>subscribes</i> to the outputs of other packages. When a simulation 
      package is thus linked to another simulation package, the need often arises to perform 
      some simple data conversions. There may for instance be a need to add a bias to the 
      output of a package, or to re-scale it, or to cast it to some new type. These operations 
      are referred to as <i>data conversions</i>. Simple data conversions are best implemented in the 
      simulation package wrapper and EODiSP wrappers may support some basic kinds of data 
      conversions.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="WrapperStructure"></a><h2>Wrapper Structure</h2>
    <p>
      In general, an EODiSP wrapper may serve two purposes: <ul> <li><i>Language Bridge</i>: 
      the EODiSP is Java-based but simulation packages may be implemented in other languages 
      (C/C++ and Fortran). The wrapper allows non-Java packages to be integrated in the 
      EODiSP. </li> <li><i>HLA Bridge</i>: the EODiSP is based on the HLA concept but simulation 
      packages are not necessarily implemented as HLA federates. The wrapper is used to 
      adapt the package interface to conform to the interface specified by the HLA standard.</li> 
      </ul> In the EODiSP, these two functions of a wrapper are implemented in three separate 
      elements. The resulting wrapper architecture is shown in the figure. Block 3 and 
      4 in the figure implement the HLA bridging function and block 2 implements the language 
      bridging function.
    </p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="wrapperStructure_1.png"><img border="0" src="../../images/wrapperStructure_1.png" alt="Structure of an EODiSP Wrapper"></img></a><p>Figure 1: Structure of an EODiSP Wrapper</p></div>
    <p>
      The architecture in the figure covers the most general kind of wrapper. In many cases,
      simpler structures can be used. Block 2, in particular, can often be omitted. 
      This will be most obviously the case when the simulation package is implemented
      in Java but it could also happen if the simulation package consist of an executable
      whose execution can be directly controlled from the connector code in block 3.
    </p>
    <p> 
      The choice of the architecture in the figure is driven by the desire to facilitate 
      the automation of the wrapper generation process. The part of the HLA bridge that 
      communicates with the EODiSP environment (Block 4) needs to implement the HLA Federate 
      Interface Specification. This code is the same for all federates and only depends 
      on the SOM the federate wants to expose. Therefore, the code implementing the federate 
      interface can be generated in the same way for any HLA federate. The EODiSP offers 
      a code generator to automatically generate this skeleton. Markers are placed in the 
      generated code to tag the places where code needs to be added to connect this implementation 
      to a simulation package (this is indicated by the two "holes" in block 4 in the Figure). 
      The inputs for the generation of the block 4 code are the object class attributes 
      the federate wants to publish or subscribe to. A SOM contains exactly this information 
      and therefore serves as the input to the code generator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HLA Federate Interface Specification also contains the code implementing the 
      data conversions. This point is discussed <a href="#DataConversion">below</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, the EODiSP wrappers have the structure shown in the figure above. In 
      order to assist users in the construction of the wrappers for their simulation packages, 
      the EODiSP at present provides two kinds of facilities: <ul> <li><a href="#HLAWrapperGenerator">HLA 
      Federate Interface Implementation Generator</a>: this is an application that automatically 
      generates the HLA federate interface implementation of a wrapper (block 4 in the 
      figure). </li>  <li><a href="../userManuals/sampleWrappers.html">Sample 
      Wrappers</a>: these are complete wrappers for particular simulation packages. They 
      are intended to be used as blueprints for the construction of user-specific wrappers. 
      </li> </ul>
      In the future, it is expected that users that operate in a certain domain where 
      models have a common structure may define <a href="#WrapperGenerators">wrapper 
      generator applications</a> that automatically generate the entire wrapper for simulation
      packages in that domain.
      
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="DataConversion"></a><h2>Data Conversion</h2>
    <p>
      Data conversions are implemented in the HLA Federate Interface layer (block 4 in 
      the figure above). Data conversion is performed on the data as it is being received 
      by a federate. This is illustrated in the next figure:
    </p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="dataConversion_1.png"><img border="0" src="../../images/dataConversion_1.png" alt="Data Conversion Example"></img></a><p>Figure 2: Data Conversion Example</p></div>
    <p>
      In the figure, federate A publishes data item x. Federates B and C subscribe to data 
      item x but need to apply two different data conversions to it: federate B wants to 
      add a bias of 1.4 to it, whereas federate C wants to perform a 10% rescaling on it. 
      If the data conversion were applied at the point where the data item is published 
      (i.e. on federate A), this double data conversion would not be possible. It becomes 
      possible if instead the data conversion is applied on federates B and C.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EODiSP wrapper generator support three types of default data conversions: <ul> 
      <li>Applying an additive bias to the input of a federate. The value of the applied 
      bias is user-defined. </li> <li>Rescaling the input of a federate by multiplying 
      it by a scaling factor. The value of the applied scaling-factor is user-defined. 
      </li> <li>Casting the type of the input of a federate to a new type. The target type 
      is user defined but is restricted to be type-compatible with the source type. </li> 
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Data conversion is implemented as follows. For each federate input, the <a href="#FederateInterfaceImplementationGenerator">HLA 
      Federate Interface Implementation Generator</a> generates, as part of the HLA interface 
      skeleton, a <code>convert</code> method. This convert method takes as an input the 
      input value for the federate and returns the converted value. The implementation 
      of the method is generated automatically. Four possible types of implementations 
      can be specified by the user for this method: <ul> <li><i>Bias</i>: the <code>convert</code> 
      method applies a fixed bias to its argument. </li> <li><i>Scaling</i>: the <code>convert</code> 
      method applies a rescaling using a fixed multiplicative factor to its argument. </li> 
      <li><i>Type_Casting</i>: the <code>convert</code> method performs a type cast on 
      its argument. Type casting is performed in accordance with the rules of the Java 
      language (recall that the HLA Federate Interface is implemented in Java). </li> <li><i>User_Defined</i>: 
      the <code>convert</code> method is empty and it returns the input value unchanged. 
      This option is useful when the user wishes to implement some very specific data conversion. 
      The conversion algorithm must then be hand-coded in the body of method <code>convert</code>. 
      </li> </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Users who wish to perform data conversions more complex than those covered by default 
      by the <a href="#FederateInterfaceImplementationGenerator">HLA Federate Interface 
      Implementation Generator</a> have two options. <ul> <li>They can implement their 
      own version of method <code>convert</code> as indicated above. </li> <li>They can 
      implement the data conversion in a dedicated federate that acts as a "bridge" between 
      the source of the unconverted data and the consumer of the converted data. </li> 
      The second option is recommended for the case where non-trivial data conversions 
      need to be performed. Note that the <a href="../userManuals/sampleFederates.html">sample 
      federates</a> provided with the EODiSP include examples of federates performing complex 
      data conversions. They can be used as templates for user-defined data conversion 
      federates. </ul>
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="HLAWrapperGenerator"></a><h2>HLA Wrapper Generator</h2>
    <p>
      The <i>HLA Wrapper Generator</i> is an EODiSP support application 
      that generates parts of the code of an HLA federate. The part of the code it generates 
      is marked as block 4 in the first figure in this page. The input to the generator 
      is the HLA interface description in the form of a SOM. The generator is implemented 
      as an XSL program. The detailed design of the XSL program can be found in the <a href="wrapperGenerators.html">generator detailed design</a>. The mode of operation 
      of the generator is shown in the figure:
    </p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="HLAInterfaceGenerator_1.png"><img border="0" src="../../images/HLAInterfaceGenerator_1.png" alt="HLA Wrapper Generator"></img></a><p>Figure 3: HLA Wrapper Generator</p></div>
    <p>
      The HLA Interface generator also generates the code implementing the <a href="#DataConversion">data 
      conversion</a>. It therefore needs information about what kind of data conversions 
      (if any) should be applied to each federate input and about the values of the conversion 
      parameters. The source for this information is still TBD.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table below lists the types of services for which the HLA Interface generator 
      generates code: <table> <tr> <th>Service</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Startup</td> 
      <td>A startup method is generated that calls appropriate HLA services to initialize 
      the federate and join it to a federation execution.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Shutdown</td> 
      <td>A shutdown method is generated that calls appropriate HLA services to cleanly 
      shutdown and resign the federate from a federation execution.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Publishing</td> 
      <td>For each HLA object class with sharing set to "Publish" a helper method is generated 
      that publishes all its attributes.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Subscription</td> <td>For 
      each HLA object class with sharing set to "Subscribe" a helper method is generated 
      that subscribes to all its attributes.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Update Attributes</td> 
      <td>For each attribute with sharing set to "Publish" an update method is generated 
      to update a particular attribute in the federation.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Reflect Attributes</td> 
      <td>For each attribute with sharing set to "Subscribe" a callback method is generated 
      that is invoked whenever the attribute value is updated by the federation.</td> </tr> 
      <tr> <td>Data Conversion</td> <td>For each attribute with sharing set to "Subscribe" 
      a method is generated to apply a user-defined <a href="#DataConversion">data conversion</a> 
      algorithm.</td> </tr> </table> The generator also generates markers that identify 
      the hooks where user-defined code has to be inserted.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="WrapperGenerators"></a><h2>Wrapper Generators</h2>
    <p>
      As indicated above, in some cases it may become advantageous to develop additional
      support applications that implement 
      <i>wrapper generators</i> capable of generating the complete wrapper 
      code for selected types of simulation packages. Such wrapper generators would generate both 
      the HLA Interface Implementation Code and the Connector Code (blocks 3 and 4 in the 
      figure at the top of this page) for the target simulation packages. The generators 
      would be typically implemented as XSL programs and would have a structure as shown in the figure:
    </p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="wrapperGenerators_1.png"><img border="0" src="../../images/wrapperGenerators_1.png" alt="Wrapper Generators"></img></a><p>Figure 4: Wrapper Generators</p></div>
    <p>
      For clarity, the figure shows two separate generation processes, one for the HLA 
      Interface code and one for the connector code. The wrapper generators however would be 
      seen by the user as single generators.
    </p>
    <p>
      The structure of the mapping files must obviously be specific to a particular category 
      of simulation packages. 
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="SupportedModels"></a><h2>Supported Models</h2>
    <p>
      For all kinds of wrappers, an <a href="#HLAWrapperGenerator">HLA 
      Federate Interface Implementation Generator</a> is provided to automatically generate 
      the HLA Interface skeleton code. For selected types of simulation packages, further 
      support may be provided in two forms: provision of sample wrappers, or provision 
      of a generator for the connector code. The table below lists the types of simulation 
      packages for which this additional support is currently available. The third column 
      indicates whether support through sample wrapper ('S') or through connector code 
      generator ('G') is provided. Note that at the time of writing no decision has yet 
      been taken as to which kind of simulation packages (if any) should be covered with a code 
      generator. This explains why in the last column all entries are 'S'.
