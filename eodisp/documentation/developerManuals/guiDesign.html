    <p>
      As described in the <a href="./guiArchitecture.html">GUI Architecture</a>, the EODiSP 
      GUI base framework is based on a slightly modified model-view-controller architecture. 
      The next figure shows the class diagram with the corresponding classes. Classes in white 
      are part of the EODiSP GUI framework and classes in red are part of the standard 
      Java Swing framework.
    </p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="./org.eodisp.ui.common.base_small.png"><img border="0" src="../../images/./org.eodisp.ui.common.base_small.png" alt="MVC components in the EODiSP GUI base framework."></img></a><p>Figure 1: MVC components in the EODiSP GUI base framework.</p></div>
    <p>
      The names of the classes correspond to the parts in the MVC architecture. One notable 
      difference is that there is an <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/base/EodispApplicationController.html">EodispApplicationController</a> 
      and an <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/base/EodispController.html">EodispController</a> 
      class. The <code>EodispApplicationController</code> is a container for <code>EodispController</code> 
      classes and is responsible for their creation and management, such as adding and 
      removing controllers. The controller classes in turn correspond to the controllers 
      in the MVC architecture. Hence, they are responsible for creating and managing their 
      frames and views.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar to the concept with the controller classes is the one for the frames in the 
      GUI framework, although a bit more complicated. There is one <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/base/EodispMainFrame.html">EodispMainFrame</a> 
      and several <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/base/EodispFrame.html">EodispFrames</a> 
      and <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/base/EodispView.html">EodispViews</a>. 
      Especially the connection to the Java Swing classes might be a bit confusing, since 
      the <code>EodispMainFrame</code> is derived from a <code>JFrame</code> whereas the 
      <code>EodispFrame</code> indirectly holds a <code>JPanel</code>. This stems from 
      the fact that the names of these Java Swing components does not correspond to the 
      names in the MVC architecture, even though the concept is very similar. In Java Swing, 
      a <code>JFrame</code> is the topmost container for a GUI application, or, in other 
      words, it is the frame for the whole application. Several <code>JPanels</code> can 
      be embedded in such a <code>JFrame</code>. A <code>JPanel</code> then displays a 
      visual component (e.g. a <code>JTree</code>). Hence, in Java Swing there is only 
      one <code>JFrame</code>, but several <code>JPanels</code> that embed visual components.
    </p>
    <p>
      This concept is quite similar to the modified MVC architecture used in the EODiSP 
      GUI framework. The names of the components are a bit different, though. The connection 
      between the components of the Java Swing and the EODiSP GUI framework concerning 
      frames and views is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <code>JFrame</code> correspond to a <code>EodispMainFrame</code>. There is only 
        one such frame and it acts as the topmost container for the application, where several 
        <code>EodispFrames</code> can be embedded.</li>
      <li>A <code>JPanel</code> correspond to a <code>EodispFrame</code>. An important difference 
        to a <code>JPanel</code> in Java Swing is, that an <code>EodispFrame</code> acts 
        as a management container for several <code>EodispViews</code>. This means, several 
        <code>EodispViews</code> can be attached to an <code>EodispFrame</code>, where one 
        of this views is the currently active view (i.e. the view which is displayed in the 
        user interface).</li>
      <li>A visual component in Java Swing correspond to a <code>EodispView</code>. A view, 
        however, has some additional functionality such as managing the connection to an 
        <code>EodispModel</code>. It also has a back reference to the <code>EodispFrame</code> 
        in which the view is embedded.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The <code>SimpleInternalFrame</code> is derived from the <code>JPanel</code> class 
      and acts therefore as a frame in the EODiSP GUI framework. The purpose of this class 
      is to extend the functionality of the <code>EodispFrame</code> with additional features 
      such as a text bar which shows the title and an icon of the active view. It can also 
      have its own tool bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visual component that is displayed at a given time in an <code>EodispFrame</code> 
      is retrieved from the currently active <code>EodispView</code>. This means, whenever 
      the active view in a frame changes, the visual component that is displayed also changes 
      automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that the visual placement of the frames is the responsibility 
      of the <code>EodispMainFrame</code>. It has to know how to layout the frames in the 
      application (at least the initial placement).
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="VisualComponents"></a><h2>Visual Components</h2>
    <p>
      Visual components are these parts of the application which are able to show data 
      from a model to a user. This can be a tree, a list, etc. These components are directly 
      taken from the Java Swing framework. For the EODiSP GUI framework, each of these 
      components is wrapped by an EODiSP component. This is done to insert some behaviour 
      that is common to all EODiSP GUI applications in one place in the code. For instance, 
      a <code>JTree</code> is wrapped by an <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/components/EodispTree.html">EodispTree</a>. 
      This tree sets some behaviour, such as that it should not be editable, etc. In the 
      EODiSP GUI framework, a visual component is referenced by a <code>EodispView</code>. 
      This view can of course override this common behaviour if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever a visual component is used in an EODiSP GUI application, a EODiSP wrapper 
      class for the original Java Swing component should be used. This ensures that common 
      behaviour can be set in one place instead of setting it for every instance of the 
      component.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="Actions"></a><h2>Actions</h2>
    <p>
      Actions are used to let a user interact with a GUI application. This can be done 
      through the use of a menu bar, a tool bar, or a context menu. In an EODiSP application, 
      all three possibilities can be used and are summarized as <i>interaction interface</i>. 
      The management of this interaction interface is quite extensive since it must support 
      many features. To handle this, the EODiSP GUI has extended the standard Java Swing 
      <code>Action</code> interface to include additional information. This is the <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/actions/EodispAction.html">EodispAction</a> 
      class. In general, an action can be used to build all of the three possible interfaces 
      included in the interaction interface. The <code>EodispAction</code> class includes 
      information such as which interface shall be built upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following list summarizes the features that must be supported by an <code>EodispAction</code>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An action can be static or dynamic. <li>A static action is always present, but can 
        be enabled and disabled at runtime. It cannot be removed from the interaction interfaces.</li> 
        <li>A dynamic action can be added or removed from the interaction interfaces at runtime.</li> 
        <li>An action is either static or dynamic, but not both. This cannot be changed at 
        runtime.</li></li>
      <li>An action can specify under which item it shall appear in the menu bar (including 
        sub-menus).</li>
      <li>An action can specify in which interaction interface it shall appear.</li>
      <li>Every <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/base/EodispView.html">EodispView</a> 
        and every <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/base/EodispFrame.html">EodispFrame</a> 
        can declare which actions it provides.</li>
      <li>An action is only active and/or visible if the frame or view which declares it is 
        visible.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To handle all of these features, an interaction management has been created for the 
      EODiSP GUI base framework. It can handle contributions to any of the interaction 
      interfaces from an <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/actions/ActionSourceHandler.html">ActionSourceHandler</a> 
      (an interface which is implemented by all classes that want to contribute to the 
      interaction interface), and is able to create a complete tool bar and menu bar which 
      can be displayed by the <code>EodispMainFrame</code>. Figure 2 shows the class diagram 
      of the interaction management. The white classes are part of the EODiSP GUI base 
      framework and the red classes are part of the Java Swing framework.
    </p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="./org.eodisp.ui.common.actions_small.png"><img border="0" src="../../images/./org.eodisp.ui.common.actions_small.png" alt="Class diagram of the interaction management."></img></a><p>Figure 2: Class diagram of the interaction management.</p></div>
    <p>
      The important parts of the interaction management are the <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/actions/EodispMenuManager.html">EodispMenuManager</a> 
      and the <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/actions/EodispActionRegistry.html">EodispActionRegistry</a>. 
      The <code>EodispMenuManager</code> class is responsible for creating the menu and 
      the tool bar. In order to be able to create the menu and tool bar, it uses the data 
      from the <code>EodispActionRegistry</code> class. This class is a registry for all 
      <code>EodispActions</code> (i.e. static and dynamic) in the EODiSP GUI. Whenever 
      an action is added, removed, or otherwise altered, the registry will fire an event. 
      The <code>EodispMenuManger</code> catches the event by implementing the <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/events/EodispActionListener.html">EodispActionListener</a> 
      class. Whenever such an event occurs, the EodispMenuManager updates the menu and 
      tool bar as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one special action that needs to be mentioned. This is the <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/actions/EmfAction.html">EmfAction</a>. 
      This is a dynamic action especially used for EMF commands. It works together with 
      the EMF edit code that is generated to handle XML model data (e.g. an application's 
      project file). An <code>EmfAction</code> is always dynamic and holds an EMF command 
      that can be executed on the EMF's command stack. Such a command might be adding or 
      removing a model item from the model. Furthermore, <code>EmfActions</code> are always 
      created at runtime whenever one is needed. This will ensure that only those actions 
      are available through the interaction interface which can be executed on the model. 
      For example, if a node in the project's tree is selected, only EmfActions for adding 
      <it>valid</it> children will be created.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="ExecutionSequence"></a><h2>Execution Sequence</h2>
    <p>
      Figure 3 shows a sequence diagram which illustrates the starting sequence of an EODiSP 
      GUI application. The instances shown in the sequence diagram might be a bit confusing 
      or misleading since it shows instances of the base classes from the EODiSP GUI framework. 
      In reality, these instances are instances of a concrete application. For example, 
      the instance of an <code>EodispModel</code> could be the <code>SMProjectTreeModel</code>. 
      This would be the real component serving as a model for the tree showing data from 
      the simulation manager project file. Although this instances might be incorrect, 
      the starting sequence remains the same. This, hopefully, is less confusing than introducing 
      new classes.
    </p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="./org.eodisp.ui.common.base.start-seq.png"><img border="0" src="../../images/./org.eodisp.ui.common.base.start-seq.png" alt="Sequence diagram of the starting sequence"></img></a><p>Figure 3: Sequence diagram of the starting sequence</p></div>
    <p>
      The sequence in the figure first shows the creation of an <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/base/EodispApplicationController.html">EodispApplicationController</a>. 
      This instance is created by the an <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/application/EodispAppBase.html">EodispAppBase</a> 
      instance. The <code>EodispApplicationController</code> is responsible for creating 
      the <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/base/EodispMainFrame.html">EodispMainFrame</a> 
      and all <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/base/EodispController.html">EodispControllers</a> 
      of the application. An <code>EodispController</code> in turn creates its <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/base/EodispFrame.html">EodispFrames</a>, 
      <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/base/EodispView.html">EodispViews</a>, 
      and the <a href="./guiJavadoc/org/eodisp/ui/common/base/EodispModel.html">EodispModels</a> 
      and connects them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      After everything has been created, the <code>EodispMainFrame</code> adds the tool 
      and menu bar, layout all frames as appropriate and shows itself on the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sequence diagram shows only the most important method calls to start an application. 
      It explains how the MVC components are connected together and how they are created.
