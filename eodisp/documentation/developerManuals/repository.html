    <p>
      The idea behind the EODiSP respository is to have a place where all simulation and 
      model manager applications as well as all federates can register themeselves. The 
      need for such a repository stems from the fact that, in a distributed environment, 
      it is almost impossible to assemble a simulation (e.g. a federation) without offline 
      informations about the federates. Furthermore, the EODiSP requirements ask for a 
      a facility to limit access to federates that are included in a model manager. This 
      means, only some simulation manager applications are allowed to access certain federates. 
      This ensures that the model owner can control who may access his models.
    </p>
    <p>The following list summarises the basic idea behind the EODiSP repository:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A model owner shall have control over the access to his models. He can achieve this 
        by retrieving a list of registered simulation manager applications from the repository 
        and allow/deny access for a certain model for a certain simulation manager application.</li>
      <li>As a consequence to the previous requirement, a simulation manager application needs 
        to be able to register itself in the repository.</li>
      <li>A simulation manager application shall be able to retrieve a list of all federates 
        that are defined in the current simulation network in order to assemble a federation. 
        This has the advantage that federates do not need to be running at the time of federation 
        assembling.</li>
      <li>Every federate has some information attached to it. These informations can be used 
        to access the federate within the simulation network. Such informations are stored 
        in the repository along with the definition of the federate itself.</li>
      <li>Every federate shall specify to which federation it will eventually participate. 
        This makes it possible to validate a federation prior to its start. Therefore, the 
        repository shall store a list of available federations to which federates can contribute.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The basic idea behind the repository is to store informations about various parts 
      in a simulation network without the need of having these parts running all the time. 
      This, however, implies that these offline informations must be available at any time 
      for any participant in the simulation network. Therefore, the repository must be 
      running all the time, preferrably on a publicly accessible server. This ensures the 
      availability of the offline data for all participant in the simulation network. Other 
      from that, there are no specific requirements for the repository. The remote connection 
      to/from the repository will be handled by the EODiSP remote package.

      The following table is a list of detailed functional requirements. These requirements 
      are not explicitely covered by the user requirements, but are implicitely needed. 
      The table lists them more formally and in more detail. This requirements will be 
      implemented by the core implementation of the EODiSP framework. The code for the 
      repository resides in the core package (EODiSP core).

    <p>The table is organised as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Column 1</b>: A consecutive number identifying the functional requirement.</li>

            A simulation manager application that has been registered in the repository can unregister 
            itself. This function is only available for simualtion manager applications that 
            are already registered, otherwise it is ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            Identification of a simulation manager application is done through the unique identifier 
            (guid) of the application. This is stored in the repository and must match the identifier 
            of the unregister request.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever a valid unregister request arrives at the repository, all repository data 
            (see rep_01) belonging to the respective simulation manager application will be deleted.

        <td>Delete a simulation manager application.</td>
        <td>
          <p>
            In some cases, it might be useful to be able to delete simulation manager application 
            entries in the repository. For instance, if a simulation manager application installation 
            is removed, there is no way to unregister the application from the repository. The 
            delete request, however, enables the user to delete the appropriate entries.
          </p>
          <p>
            The request can be done with the repository manager application (through the GUI). 
            To identify the entry which should be deleted, the user is presented with a list 
            of registered simulation manager applications from which he can choose from. Once 
            an entry is selected, a deregister request will be executed in order to delete the 
            appropriate entry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allowing this request is dangerous in a sense that all entries in the repository 
            can be deleted. However, as long as no problem (and no requirements) in this direction 
            occur, this request can be done without restriction. At a later stage, it might be 
            possible to extend it to only allow this request for registered user (by querying 
            for a password or similar).

            application from the repository</li> <li>Unregister model manager application from

            A federate that is registered in the repository can be categorized. Each category 
            can have zero to many federates that are logically grouped. Usually, this means that 
            a category represents one federation execution. As a consequence, federates in a 
            category should work together in a sense that the form a complete federation execution, 
            where the outputs of one federate are consumed by another federate and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following informations are stored with each category: <ul> <li>The name of the 
            category as string.</li> <li>A list of SOM's that are linked with this category.</li> 
            <li>A boolean value indicating whether a category is closed or open. In a closed 
            category, no additional federates can be added.</li> </ul>

          <p>
            Categories can be created in the repository manager application (through the GUI 
            application). If a category already exists, this request will be ignored, otherwise, 
            a new repository will be created. Repositories are organized in a flat dimension 
            (as opposed to a hierachical organization).

            The information stored along with a category in the repository can be changed. The 
            following list indicates which values can be changed with an update request:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The name of the category</li>
            <li>The boolean value indicating whether a category is closed or open.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If the name is changed to a value which is already defined in the repository, the 
            request will be ignored. A change request can be performed with the repository manager 
            application (through the GUI application).
          </p>
          <p>
            The list of SOM's that are linked to the repository (see rep_05) is updated automatically 
            whenever a SOM is added to the category. Therfore, it is not needed to update this 
            values manually.

          <p>
            A SOM (Simulation Object Model) can be added to the repository. A SOM defines the 
            in- and output of a federate. It can be either added to no, one or more categories. 
            It is possible that several federates comply to a single SOM (i.e. implementing the 
            interface defined by the SOM). If the same SOM is already stored in the repository, 
            the request will be ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            The SOM itself is complient with the IEEE HLA specification and is not modified by 
            the repository. The values that are stored within a SOM can therefore defined by 
            the standard.
          </p>

      The repository stores data that can be changed. In general, it would be possible 
      to store this changes in a history from where changes could be redone, viewed, etc. 
      This functionality, however, is not implemented in the EODiSP respository.

    <p>
      Since the EODiSP respository can be accessed from different sources (e.g. simulation/model 
      manager applications), it must provided the means to ensure that there are no problems 
      related to synchronization.
