      This page gives access to user-level information describing how to install and operate 
      the EODiSP. This information is organized as a set of pages that cover various aspects 
      of EODiSP usage. The information in these pages is intended for end users of the 
      EODiSP. Developer-level information is available <a href="developerManuals.html">elsewhere</a> 
      on the EODiSP web site.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EODiSP is a simulation framework built on the <a HREF="https://www.dmso.mil/public/transition/hla/">High 
      Level Architecture</a> (HLA). The HLA is defined by an IEEE standard. In order to 
      understand the information presented in this page and, indeed, in order to use the 
      EODiSP, familiarity with the HLA is necessary. It is not the purpose of this page 
      or of this web site to provide an introduction to the HLA. This can be found in several 
      publicly accessible documents. However, a brief description of the HLA together with 
      a description of the general EODiSP concept is available in the <a href="../overview.html">project 
      overview page</a>.

  <p>
  The programs are available either as source code from a svn repository or as self-contained <i>.jar</i> files.
  Here it is assumed that you download the jar files from the website.
  </p>
  <p>
  You will find all programs on the <a href="../download.html#BinaryPackages">download page</a> of this 
  website. There a six main programs available. You can download and run them independently by issuing 
  the following command on a command line:
  </p>
  <code>
java -jar &lt;eodisp_xxx&gt;.jar [options]
  </code>
  <p>
  On windows, running the program is even simpler and can be done by double-clicking directly on the <i>.jar</i> file.

    <p>
      The mode of operation of the EODiSP is defined by a set of configuration files. The 
      configuration files are simple text-based files with [key, value] pairs, each identifying 
      and setting a specific value. A description of each value is given in the respective file 
      and will not be repeated here. All required configuration files are automatically created
      by the application itself if it is missing (i.e. the first time the application is started).
    </p>
    <p>
      Several configuration files are defined, each covering a particular aspect of the 
      EODiSP operation. A single EODiSP application may therefore be controlled by several
      configuration files. 
    </p>  
    <p>
      Configuration files have names like: <code>xxx.conf</code> and they are all located in the
      same directory <code>&lt;working-dir&gt;/conf</code> where <code>&lt;working-dir&gt;</code>
      is the working directory of the EODiSP application (recall that the working directory 
      of an EODiSP application can be set as a startup parameter for every EODiSP 
      application by providing a value to the <i>--working-dir</i> parameter).
    </p>
    
    <p>  
      The table below lists all the EODiSP configuration files:
    </p>  
    <table>
      <tr>

      As an example, suppose you wish to find the configuration file covering distribution issues
      for the Model Manager application. 
      Suppose too that the model manager runs on a Unix machine and that it is started with the default
      working directory (which is <code>~/.eodisp/model_manager</code>). The desired configuration
      file would then be:
      <code>~/.eodisp/model_manager/conf/remote.conf</code>.

  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="TestCases"></a><h2>Test Cases</h2>
      The EODiSP test cases describe various aspects of the operation 
      of the EODiSP. Each test case defines a step-by-step procedure to achieve a certain 
      objective and it specifies the criteria to determine whether the test case was successful. 
      The test cases may depend on each other in the sense that execution of test case 
      A may first require the successful execution of test case B. Such dependencies are 
      clearly spelt out in the test case description. 
    <p>  
      Four groups of test cases are identified, one for each of the four applications
      provided by the EODiSP: the simulation manager application, the model manager application,
      the repository application, and the support application.
    </p>
    <p>  
      The full set of EODiSP test cases is presented in list form in a 
      <a href="useAndTestCases.html#EODiSPTestCases">dedicated page</a> which also contains
      the links to the individual test case descriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
    Many of the test cases rely on the
    <a href="http://www.pnp-software.com/earthcare_simulator" class="external">EarthCARE Simulator</a>as a demonstration platform.
    <a href="./useAndTestCases/earthCAREConfiguration.html">This page</a>

    <p>
      The EODiSP is a platform that simulation developers can use to build a simulation 
      application. The process whereby the EODiSP deliverables as provided in this web 
      site are used to build a simulation application is called <i>instantiation</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The input to the instantiation process is the set of simulation packages that must 
      be integrated together to build the target simulation. The basic steps in the instantiation 
      process are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the definition of the simulation architecture,</li>
      <li>the development of the wrappers for the simulation packages, and</li>
      <li>the registration of the resulting HLA federates in the EODiSP repository.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Given the <a href="../overview.html">data-driven paradigm</a> underlying the EODiSP, 
      the first step basically entails identifying the input and output data of each simulation 
      package. More formally, it entails defining the interface of the federates that will 
      represent the simulation packages in the EODiSP simulation. The description of these 
      interfaces can first be done informally but must eventually be done using a formalism 
      prescribed by the HLA. For this purpose, the HLA defines an XML-based language and 
      for each federate a <i>Simulation Object Model</i> or SOM must be defined. The SOM 
      is an XML-based document that fully describes the type of information that an individual 
      federate can provide to an HLA federation as well as the information that an individual 
      federate can receive from other federates in the HLA federation. The structure of 
      the SOM is defined by the HLA standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second step in the instantiation process, <a href="../overview.html#Wrappers">wrappers</a> 
      are developed that transform the simulation packages into HLA federates that comply 
      with the SOM's defined in the first step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the simulation packages have been wrapped as HLA federates, they can be registered 
      into the EODiSP repository from where they are available to participate in an EODiSP 
      application. This registration process is done through the <a href="../overview.html#EODiSPUserInterface">EODiSP 
      model manager application</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For demonstration purposes, a complete instantiation of the EODiSP has been done 
      to build the <a href="http://www.pnp-software.com/earthcare_simulator" class="external">EarthCARE 
      Simulator</a>. Readers can refer to the simulator web site for concrete examples of how 
      the above three steps can be carried out.
    </p>
  <div class="gotToTop"><a href="#_top">top ^</a></div></div><div class="section"><a name="EODiSPExtension"></a><h2>EODiSP Extension</h2>
    <p>
      The EODiSP is provided under a free and open software licence. Users can therefore 
      extend it by modifying its implementation or by adding new functionalities to it.
    </p>  
    <p>
      Developers who wish to extend the EODiSP need to understand its architecture. This 
      is described in the EODiSP <a href="developerManuals.html">developer's guide</a>. 
      This page also gives access to the detailed design documentation for the EODiSP in 
      Javadoc format. The EODiSP software can be accessed from the <a href="../download.html">download 
      page</a>.
    </p>  
      Typical extensions that users may want to do include:
    <ul>
      <li>At present, the EODiSP only implements a <a href="developerManuals/implementedHLAServices.html">subset 
        of the HLA services</a>. This subset could be extended to improve the coverage of the
        HLA standard. This extension would only affect the HLA layer of the <a href="developerManuals/generalArchitecture.html">EODiSP architecture</a>.</li>
      <li>The EODiSP networking 
        layer could be upgraded or replaced. This layer is currently based on the JXTA framework 
        and its definition was driven 
        by the requirements that the EODiSP be able to support the development of distributed 
        simulations where some of the simulation models are located behind firewalls. Accommodating 
        this requirement has led to design choices that are marginally suboptimal in terms 
        of execution speed. Users who are interested in maximizing performance may want to 
        replace or modify the EODiSP network layer. Note that the EODiSP has a layered <a href="developerManuals/generalArchitecture.html">architecture</a> that is intended 
        to allow this kind of selective upgrades or replacements.</li>
      <li>Tthe backend in the <a href="../overview.html#EODiSPRepository">repository 
        implementation</a> could be replaced. Currently, EMF is used to store the data in the repository. The 
        format in which this data is stored is XML. This implementation is stable and suits 
        the need of the current requirements of the EODiSP. However, if a repository grows 
        very large, it could be beneficial to replace this implementation with a relational 
        database to increase data handling performance as well as improve memory footprint of the 
        repository application. Note that such a change would not be trivial, since it affects not 
        only the repository code itself, but also the code in the client applications (i.e. 
        the manager applications).</li>
