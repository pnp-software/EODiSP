    <p>
      The control federate manages the life-cycle of a federation execution by using HLA 
      <i>synchronization points </i>. Generally, synchronization points in HLA work as 
      follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The control federate registers a synchronization point for a group of federates, 
        called the <i>synchronization group</i>.</li>
      <li>The RTI announces this newly registered synchronization point to all federates in 
        the synchronization group.</li>
      <li>Each federate of the synchronization group informs the RTI when it reaches the synchronization 
        point (after receiving the sync point announcement).</li>
      <li>The RTI informs all federates in the synchronization group that the synchronization 
        point is achieved (the federation is synchronized at this point), as soon as all 
        federates have informed the RTI that they achieved it.</li>
      <li>The synchronization point is removed from the RTI</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In the context of an EODiSP simulation the synchronization points are used to implement 
      the start/stop and pause/resume functionality. However before synchronization points 
      can come into play, two other problems need to be solved:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How does the control federate know that all federates that participate in a federation 
        execution have joined?</li>
      <li>How can the control federate get the handles of the federates that are part of a 
        synchronization group?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The first problem can only (in a manner that is compliant with other RTI implementations) 
      be solved by using the Management Object Model (MOM) of the RTI. The MOM is a standard 
      HLA simulation object model (SOM) that publishes data about a current federation 
      execution. This includes information about the joined federates. The control federate 
      knows the number of federates (from the simulation manager) that will join a federation 
      execution and hence, knows when all federates have joined a federation execution 
      by subscribing to the MOM's <code>Federate</code> class and count its instances.
    </p>.
    <p>
      The second problem stems from the fact that the control federate does not know if 
      all of the federates that have joined to the federation execution, take part in the 
      EODiSP simulation life-cycle (start/stop/pause/resume) as well. It is possible that 
      only some of the joined federates are 100% EODiSP compatible federates, i.e. are 
      federates that know about the EODiSP simulation life-cycle functionality and the 
      associated synchronization points. The solution is again, that this information is 
      received from the simulation manager, that means that the simulation manager tells 
      the control federate how many of the federates that take part in the federation execution 
      also take part in the EODiSP simulation life-cycle. Unfortunately this information 
      is not enough, because building a synchronization group needs the handles of each 
      federate that takes part in a synchronization (point). This information is only known 
      by the participating federates themselves, just after they have joined (the join 
      service returns the federate handle). Therefore each federate that wants to take 
      part in the EODiSP simulation life-cycle, needs to publish an HLA interaction called 
      'RegisterFederate( FederateHandle handle )'. The control federate subscribes to this 
      interaction and waits until all federates have registered their handles (by sending 
      the interaction). The control federates knows for how many 'RegisterHandle' interactions 
      it has to wait for because it knows, from the simulation manager, how many federates 
      take part in the EODiSP simulation life- cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, that these problems are solves, synchronization points can be used to implement 
      the start, stop, pause and resume functionality.
    </p>
    <h2>Start</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The control federate registers the 'EODISP_START' synchronization point for the group 
        of federates that were registered with the 'RegisterHandle' interaction (see above).</li>
      <li>The federates in the group are informed about this synchronization point</li>
      <li>Each federate (the control federates included) in the group sends a 'synchronization 
        point achieved' to the RTI for this synchronization point when it is ready to start.</li>
      <li>The RTI informs the control federate and all other federates that the synchronization 
        point has been achieved. The federates can now start publishing data. Note, that 
        only some federates will initially (after the 'EODISP_START' sync point has been 
        reached) publish data, others will wait until they receive data from other federates.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Pause</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The control federate registers the 'EODISP_PAUSE' synchronization point for the group 
        of federates that take part in the EODiSP life-cycle (see above).</li>
      <li>The federates in the group are informed about this synchronization point</li>
      <li>Each federate (the control federates included) in the group sends a 'synchronization 
        point achieved' to the RTI for this synchronization point when it is ready to pause.</li>
      <li>The RTI informs the control federate and all other federates that the synchronization 
        point has been achieved. The federates now pause, stop receiving and updating data.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Resume</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The control federate registers the 'EODISP_RESUME' synchronization point for the 
        group of federates that take part in the EODiSP life-cycle (see above).</li>
      <li>The federates in the group are informed about this synchronization point</li>
      <li>Each federate (the control federates included) in the group sends a 'synchronization 
        point achieved' to the RTI for this synchronization point when it is ready to resume.</li>
      <li>The RTI informs the control federate and all other federates that the synchronization 
        point has been achieved. The federates resume, begin to publish and receive data.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Stop</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The control federate registers the 'EODISP_STOP' synchronization point for the group 
        of federates that take part in the EODiSP life-cycle (see above).</li>
      <li>The federates in the group are informed about this synchronization point</li>
      <li>Each federate (the control federates included) in the group sends a 'synchronization 
        point achieved' to the RTI for this synchronization point when it is ready to stop.</li>
      <li>The RTI informs the control federate and all other federates that the synchronization 
        point has been achieved. The federates stop and resign from the federation execution.</li>
    </ol>
